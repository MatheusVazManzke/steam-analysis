    "We will be working with a Steam store dataset. Each row contains data for a game in the store. We will be restricting or dataset to small scale indie games. Successful games are those with more than 500 reviews. \n",

    "By restricting ourselves to the 'about the game' column, we are going to try to find group differences between those games that are successful, acording to the above metric, and those that are not. Our hypothesis is simple: Even though the reasons for a game's success are probably due to deeper factors that are not neatly reflected in the available data, to some extent, emulating the characteristics of a successful game's description could improve our chances of succeding, specially for low-budget, small scale games whose Steam pages are the main source of information for the potential buyer."

       " \"Aeterna Noctis is a challenging 2D hand-drawn action platformer, a Metroidvania with thrilling combat that will keep you on the edge of your seat and heart-stopping platform sections that will put your skills to the \\xa0test. Play as the King of Darkness and explore 16 connected areas in an epic journey to regain your powers.\\xa0 Unnumbered years ago, the supreme god Chaos created the Universe and the world of Aeterna. After populating it with different races and creatures, he appointed powerful rulers to govern them and show them the way. But soon they turned against their Creator, seeking to take the world for themselves; and gathered their subjects in two groups that fought each other -- and thus gave rise to war, death and hatred. The all-powerful Chaos was angered, and in His terrible wrath He cast a terrible curse upon the rebellious leaders. He named them King of Darkness and Queen of Light, and condemned them to keep fighting each other forever, until the end of time. Not even death would free them from this doom, for Chaos granted them the Gift of Immortality -- so that even if one managed to defeat the other, they would be reborn, and regain their powers to continue their eternal war.\\xa0 Difficulty level The world of Aeterna Noctis features a challenging difficulty system that scales progressively as you the player go through the game and get more experienced with the controls and unlock new skills. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, always offering a challenge with each encounter, but also resulting in a great sense of pride after completing each challenge.\\xa0If you are a lover of Metroidvania games, in Aeterna Noctis there is a perfect game mode for you, the Aeterna Mode. However, if extreme challenges and platforming are what you want, you are a Noctis Mode player. But do you know what the differences are between these game modes? We explain it to you. - Aeterna Mode (A pure Metroidvania experience) In essence, the game has been completely redesigned to offer you as a player a 100% Metroidvania experience where action and exploration are the protagonists. If it's one of your favorite genres, don't miss the opportunity to get lost in a huge open world with 16 unique areas and hundreds of enemies with unique mechanics. The challenge lies in recovering your power and facing fearsome final bosses that will demand the most of you. - Noctis Mode (Platforms and extreme challenges) We could say that for the first time two genres such as Metroidvania and platform games have been mixed. Playing on this mode, you will not only have to explore and recover your powers, but you will also face constant puzzles, platform sections and challenges only recommended for the most demanding players. If you think this is not for you, we do not recommend playing on Noctis Mode since frustration can ruin the experience. This mode includes all the achievements, so it is also ideal for completionist players or for those who, after beating Aeterna mode, want to enjoy the title again with more difficulty. In Aeterna Mode, the spikes have been removed from the platforms to make it easier to fight the enemy. This way you can slide and lean on the platforms without worrying about environmental hazards. In Aeterna Mode, the chainsaw puzzle is replaced by an enemy encounter. This way the gaming experience is more focused on exploration and action, moving away from more challenging puzzles. In Aeterna Mode, environmental hazards have been removed so navigation through the level is less demanding and doesn't require pinpoint accuracy. In Aeterna Mode, you have more hazard-free space to jump, dodge, and attack enemies. In Noctis Mode, you are required to be more precise with the controls to avoid all environmental hazards, such as spikes. Playing in Noctis Mode you have to pay attention to breakable platforms and time your jumps correctly, while in Aeterna Mode you can move more freely without the need for precise jumps and dashes. What if I started in Noctis mode and the difficulty is too much for me? Or... What if I started in Aeterna mode but want a more challenging experience? The player can switch between one mode or the other at any time without losing progress and reloading the game at the last save point, allowing the Aeterna Noctis experience to be shaped at your will. Fluid gameplay mechanics In a game with such a difficulty curve that scales with progression, Aeterna Noctis features extremely responsive controls, allowing for precise movement and combat. High mobility Intuitive world design allowing the players to exploit the precise movement controls of the character, allowing you to overcome each challenge in a multitude of ways. As you become more skilled in the game, it allows you to get even faster completion times.\\xa0 Deep, beautiful plot Featuring an immersive and emotional story with incredible moments, filled with unexpected twists that will immerse the players into the rich world of Aeterna Noctis. Traditional 2D Art Worldbuilding in Aeterna Noctis is completed by handcrafting each asset, animation and environmental detail in the game using traditional illustration methods by the art team, giving rise to a vibrant and beautifully assembled world. Freedom of choice Aeterna Noctis features a defined path for the storyline, but allows the player to take whatever path and pacing to navigate the expansive non-linear map featuring 16 different zones, interconnected in a classic metroidvania style.\\xa0 More than 40 music tracks Aeterna Noctis features over 40 unique tracks each with its own theme. Once the game is made available, the OST will be released with special covers of the main songs as a piano collection\",\n",

The population is being terrorized by a reckless army; in the meantime the main export goods are drugs. Subversion and fraudulence has infiltrated all levels of local government and the ever-present Mafia has his fingers in many pies. You are working undercover on behalf of the US government and your goal is to destroy the mighty drug cartel. You'll need a skilled hand to put together the right team of mercenaries and the negotiating skills of a diplomat to get the sceptical population on to your side. You'll also need the strategic genius of a general and the fighting tactics of a guerrilla. Should you fail, your 'client' will deny all knowledge of your existence. Jagged Alliance 2 Awards: Gameplay An exciting mix of strategy and role-playing that puts you in charge of a nation's fight for freedom. Your objectives are - to hire a core group of skilled professionals through A.I.M., the Association of International Mercenaries; to win the local population over to your side by displaying courage and loyalty; to train your men around the clock and then send them into dangerous missions and lethal fire fights and to conquer the depths of underground mines, reap their riches and discover their secrets. Each success will bring you closer to total victory, while each failure must be overcome with iron determination. Sometimes a tactical withdrawal can bring you more benefits than a battle for battle's sake. Retreat from one sector only to surprise the enemy by attacking on another flank. At the beginning, some of your enemy's bases may seem to be impregnable - but don't despair - you will have to become stronger step by step and slowly gain ground.

       " 'Guns of Icarus Online is the original PvP steampunk airship combat game that laid the groundwork for the expanded Guns of Icarus experience, Guns of Icarus Alliance . Slip the surly bonds of earth and take to the skies as a bold Captain, fearless Gunner, or cunning Engineer. Raising the stakes on team-based PvP combat with an emphasis on strategic competition and team play, Guns of Icarus Online is all about teamwork, tactics, and fast-paced action. With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies! A vivid steampunk world Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution. Build your own airship Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it. Your ship is your life Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - “life” - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory. The ultimate multiplayer team experience You won’t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together. It’s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member. Goggles, gears, and glory A wide range of costumes and cosmetic options to show off your style are available in the in-game store. These items are cosmetic only - there is no pay-to-win in Guns of Icarus Online. Pit crew against crew Form a party with up to 4 friends and crew a ship together to battle against other teams in massive airship battles with up to 32 players in a match with multiple game modes including Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Crazy King, Skyball, and VIP. Rise in the ranks Earn titles and cosmetic upgrades through your achievements. Balanced, competitive matches reward strategic, skillful play, not level grinding. The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback. Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable. We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus , was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game. We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance , the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017.',\n",

       " \"\\u200b Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last. Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have. In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events. Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.

       " 'X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. Features Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle Online flying with other virtual pilots Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you Accurate terrain, roads and more Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery New rendering engine with innovative global lighting 64 Bit optimized Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come) Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR) printed “Quick Start Guide” included Default Scenery Having installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region.

       " \"Body tracking, head and hand tracking, controller emulation, and utilities. When using the Driver4VR for the first time, it MUST be started from the 'Launch' button, to ensure any additional services and drivers it requires get installed. If you have issues with installation please reach out to the support website . Driver4VR is also the main source of funding for WalkinVR, the first software that allows people with disabilities to play Virtual Reality games. Driver4VR allows adding body tracking for your existing VR setups like Oculus, HTC Vive, or Valve Index. For 3DoF Headsets like phone-vr, PSVR or VRTek, Driver4VR can add position tracking and controller emulation. It also uses alternative devices (previous generation consoles, mice, keyboard) to emulate virtual reality controllers and input. Body tracking Driver4VR can emulate body tracking with Kinect, PS Controllers with PS Eye cameras via PSMoveService, Nolo VR. There is also an experimental way of tracking with a single PS Eye camera and Camera Markers. Calibration of these body trackers with your existing VR setup is very quick and easy. (tVR) - Virtual Reality on Monitor or TV Driver4VR allows the play of some of the Virtual Reality games on TV and this is called (tVR). This is an alternative way to consume VR content for people who for some reason can't consume VR in a classic way that is with headset and controllers. Head and hand tracking, emulation of the controller Driver4VR can also add positional tracking (6DoF) in case you have a headset that just supports the rotation like phone-based VR, VR Tek, Pimax, etc. It uses Kinect to emulate positional tracking. Please note that we are using alternative tracking methods to approximate a true 6DOF experience. You may want to look into Oculus Quest or similar devices at a cheap price for the head and hands tracking, and use Driver4VR for only the body tracking - feet and waist. Controllers can be emulated with devices like PS Move, Joy-Con, Wii Remote, VR Gamepad, Mouse, Xbox Controller, Keyboard. Combined with positional tracking makes a complete virtual reality setup with hand tracking and input. Without Kinect you can use those devices alone to emulate position a'la Oculus Go which is called Virtual Tracking. Utilities Driver4VR is also set of utilities like Virtual Move, Input Emulation, fix floor position, emulation of broken Index thumbstick with touchpad, and others. Requirements Bluetooth devices (Bluetooth connection required) - Nintendo Switch JoyCon - Nintendo Wii Remote - PS3 Move - VR Gamepad Kinect - Kinect 360 - Kinect 360 adapter and standard USB 2.0 - Kinect 2.0 - Kinect 2.0 adapter and USB 3.0\",\n",

       " \"Story Riki Naoe lost his parents as a child, and fell deep into despair. He was saved by a group of kids who called themselves the Little Busters: Kyousuke Natsume, Masato Inohara, Kengo Miyazawa, and Rin Natsume. They took him and played at being heroes who fought tireless evil around them. Riki discovered endless joy in spending time with his new friends, even though the group was silly and their missions tended to end in failure. Over time, it washed away his loneliness and suffering. Years later, the whole gang was attending the same school, and Riki became a second-year. They were still as silly as ever and spent their youth following Kyousuke's silly ideas. Description 'Little Busters!' is a hit visual novel that was originally released in Japan in 2007. In the following year, 'Little Busters! Ecstasy' edition came out, promoting Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa to heroines, and adding an all-new heroine, Saya Tokido. In 2012, the 'Little Busters! PERFECT EDITION' was released with improvements in the 'Little Busters! Ecstasy' scenarios. In 2012 and 2013, the game was made into two anime series 'Little Busters!' and 'Little Busters! ~Refrain~'. Both series are available and have gained a large following in many countries outside of Japan as well. 'Little Busters! English Edition' is a new version that further enhances 'Little Busters! PERFECT EDITION'. This new edition supports HD resolution for the first time on PC, and allows dynamic switching between Japanese and English text. Characters RIKI NAOE Ordinary Boy with an Extraordinarily Lively Youth The protagonist. Riki is a bit weak-willed, yet very considerate toward his friends. He always gets involved in the ruckus caused by the troublemakers around him. Riki also plays an important role as the straight man in his pals' idiotic comedy routines. KYOUSUKE NATSUME Leader who Turns Ordinary Days into Missions Kyousuke is the only third-year in the team and leads the team. The mysterious side of his personality attracts many girls unbeknownst to him while he enjoys boys' comics like a little kid. MASATO INOHARA Lovable Straight Muscle Idiot Masato is simply a muscle idiot. He dedicates his life to bodybuilding and fighting. Masato and Kengo are like cats and dogs, always fighting each other. No one but Kyousuke is capable of arbitrating their fights. KENGO MIYAZAWA Masato's Strongest Rival Kengo is a different type of idiot from Masato, one who devotes himself to kendo. He pretends to be cool and collected, but is actually impulsive and short-tempered under his exterior. Unlike the rest of the team, he has a somewhat cynical nature. KOMARI KAMIKITA Height: 159cm Weight: 45kg Measurements: 83, 57, 84 Peerlessly Cute Fairy Tale Girl Komari is a girl who loves picture books, fairy tales, and sweets. She is so careless and clumsy that she often messes things up and ends up bringing herself to tears. She lives her life seeking 'wonderful things' and 'keys to happiness.' Komari is, in short, an optimistic airhead. RIN NATSUME Height: 153cm Weight: 43kg Measurements: 77, 54, 80 Prideful Kitten who Doesn't Easily Take to Others Rin is Kyousuke's little sister. She is rather unsociable, having grown up under the protection of her brother. She tends to act before she thinks. She is often seen using high kicks when a particular person does or says something silly. HARUKA SAIGUSA Height: 163cm Weight: 49kg Measurements: 81, 59, 82 Easygoing Noisy Girl Haruka is not in the same class as Riki, but for some reason can always be found in his classroom. Where she goes, trouble always follows. She either gleefully involves herself, or gets caught up in the mess. She basically flies by the seat of her pants without taking anything seriously. KUDRYAVKA NOUMI Height: 145cm Weight: 37kg Measurements: 69, 51, 72 Exotic (Self-Proclaimed) Mascot Kudryavka has a very Japanese personality, influenced by her Japanophile grandfather, despite having been born and raised outside Japan. She doesn't like that fact and forces herself to speak English. She is actually younger than the rest of the team. Everyone around her adores and picks on her as a mascot. Her friends call her 'Kud.' YUIKO KURUGAYA Height: 170cm Weight: 55kg Measurements: 90, 60, 89 A Tad Mischievous Anego Yuiko is one of Riki's classmates, the very personification of an 'Anego.' Everybody around her counts on her because of her confidence bordering on arrogance and keen insight. She also loves cute girls. MIO NISHIZONO Height: 153cm Weight: 41kg Measurements: 75, 55, 79 Parasol-Holding Silent Beauty Mio is a quiet girl who spends every recess reading by herself. She is diligent in everything she does but sometimes goes off into her own little world after getting the wrong idea about things. She never forgets to take her parasol with her when going out. SAYA TOKIDO Height: 156cm Weight: 44kg Measurements: 83, 55, 82 Invincible Airhead One side of Saya is a cute girl liked by everybody in her class. The other side is a mysterious spy who at night searches the school grounds for the 'treasure' hidden and protected by the Darkness Executives that she occasionally engages. KANATA FUTAKI Height: 163cm Weight: 47kg Measurements: 80, 57, 82 Blunt, Unsociable, and Tactless Prefect Kanata is the head prefect at school. She is inflexible, unfriendly, and doesn't hesitate before showering people with insults. She has persistent hostility toward any student who 'corrupts public morals.' SASAMI SASASEGAWA Height: 154cm Weight: 43kg Measurements: 78, 54, 81 Self-Centered Cat Queen Sasami is the hope of the softball club and a prideful girl always accompanied by her followers. For some reason she considers Rin as her rival. Many people stutter when attempting to pronounce her tongue twister-like name.

Combat The combat of OrbusVR has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of room-scale VR. That means instead of just mashing buttons on an ability bar, you actually have to hone your physical skill to become more effective at combat. For example, there's no tab-targetting for Rangers, who have to actually aim and hit targets with their bow. And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols of runespeak. Whether you're looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer's orbs, you'll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you've ever played. Relax When you're ready to put down your sword for the day, you've got some great options available to kick back and relax. Fishing is a great way to pass the time and earn a little dram while you're at it. Or spend time with your pet dragon and put them through the paces at one of the many dragon racing courses throughout the world. When you finish with that, head to your Player House – customizable to your personal style with furniture and decor – to craft a potion or tinker with blueprints and resources to create your own tools and furniture. Feeling social instead? Head to the Highsteppe Tavern to catch up with fellow adventurers. VR Support From the Beginning OrbusVR has been designed from the ground-up for desktop VR systems. As such we have full support for 180-degree (front facing) and 360-degree tracking setups. We've also got all kinds of great options for locomotion, including Teleport and Sliding, as well as the ability to customize your forward direction, smooth and snap turning, and even dual-joystick support for strafe/move and turn at the same time! Note that for the absolute best experience, we do recommend a 360-degree tracking setup.\",\n",

       " \"Astrox Imperium is my attempt to create the space game that I wanted to play, but no one had created. I wanted a single player, open-world space game that is similar to games I enjoyed, like Homeworld and EVE, with economies, factions, and a story. A game where I could set all the parameters, and the universe would come alive with new challenges each time I played. I tried to take the best of what I liked from many of my favorite space games, and combine them into something simple but deep, familiar yet fresh, and enjoyably addicting to play. The human struggle to survive is an all too familiar one. As the planet collapsed into an ecological depression, mankind as a whole is forced to expand his vision to the skies. A grand ship was built, and the ‘Imperium’ was scheduled to launch mankind into the future. With a new Quantum technology at its core, the Imperium was mankind’s greatest achievement. Putting aside all differences, the people of world came together. Under a common goal, the efforts of an entire generation came to fruition. The Imperium was ready to carry the dreams of us all, and with it, the hopes of finding a second chance. Not any one person knows the whole truth, but from what can be gathered, here is what we know. The Imperium was destroyed, and many of the human pioneers perished during the event. The survivors congregated together and began to build a temporary home from the wreckage of the ship itself. At first they waited for rescue, but it wasn’t long before the first ones accepted their fate. It has been 230 years now, and mankind has been quite busy out there in the stars. The story of the Imperium, passed down through the generations, have all but faded away completely. The main game play loops are fairly simple, and familiar. What makes Astrox Imperium unique, is the way that you can easily glide between the various loops to maintain a nice level of progression, without it feeling any more ‘grindy’ than you want it to. Sure, you can just mine rocks if you want, but Astrox Imperium provides you many different ways to progress your pilot. As with most space games of this genre, mining is a big mechanic of Astrox. It is the easiest way to earn credits, and most players are familiar with how it works. You can also complete contract missions. These are randomly generated missions that offer a variety of task and objectives to complete. Some of these contracts are combat missions that will involve raiders, pirates, and sometimes regular npcs. The combat missions offer a bit more action to an otherwise relaxed game. The rate at which you choose to progress is up to you. You are given a number of game options allowing you to adjust 'the grind' and speed of the game. There are a number of small, interesting little mechanics sprinkled throughout the game that were given a lot of thought and care, but you will not find anything groundbreaking or innovative here. This game is meant to feel comfortable and familiar. The game play loops are designed to be simple enough to understand quickly, and complex enough to enjoy over many hours of play. Many of the classic mechanics from the space game genre have been incorporated into Astrox Imperium. Basic interface controls were designed using elements from some RTS and FPS games. All the fan favorites and core game play elements have been included; mining, crafting, trading, refining, fleets, combat, exploration, survival, and more. This game will seem familiar to fans of the space survival / exploration game genre. Here is a list of features that are currently in the game. Check out our community forum if you are looking for more information about upcoming features. Basic Features Overview All features listed here are currently in this Early Access Release. Open World - Free to do as you please, go where you want, do what you want. Exploration - Over 100 maps to explore, each with unique resources, stations, structures and secrets.

Combat - Real time, dynamic, tactical and strategic. hundreds of weapons, ECM, drones, bombs , ships and more. Smart AI - Intelligent, and plays by the same rules are you do. Life support -expand your range of exploration, manage and upgrade your life support systems. Ships-Currently over 70 ships and growing. Drones -10 unique drones , each with special abilities. Automate their control, or manually manage their tasks. Fleets - Build a fleet of up to 10 Merc ships. Command and control their actions individually or as a group. What NOT to expect Astrox is NOT a fast-paced space shooter... there is no mouse aiming. Astrox is NOT an idle game. There are things you can do AFK, but this game requires user input to play. Astrox is NOT multiplayer. I may add some co-op in the future, but Astrox will never be a MMORPG. Astrox does NOT have AAA quality models and textures. Many are placeholders and will be replaced. Astrox is NOT another vaporware EA project. The original Astrox launched on March 23rd 2014 What to expect from me, the developer. I will listen to all feedback, and do my best to adjust the game to make it the best it can be. I will not leave for any extended period of time during the Early Access phase of the game. I will update the game frequently with bug fixes taking priority over new features and shiny do-dads. I will be extremely active, accessible, and available on our forums and discord channels. I will not ruin the game with in-game payments, subscriptions, or anything that requires additional payment. I will always be extremely thankful and grateful that you took some time out of your life to play Astrox. Thank you!\",\n",

       " \"【GAME DETAILS】 Exoprimal is an online, team-based action game that pits humanity's cutting-edge exosuit technology against history's most ferocious beasts – dinosaurs. Exosuits are grouped into different roles, and players will pilot these exosuits to hold firm against overwhelming dinosaur swarms in online-only, team-based action game modes. 【STORY】 The year is 2040… Sudden dinosaur outbreaks have engulfed the globe in a crisis that threatens humanity's very existence. Yet all hope is not lost. The corporation Aibius has developed a hyper-advanced AI called Leviathan that can predict the location of future outbreaks. This technology, along with Aibius's revolutionary powered suits, or exosuits, gives humanity a fighting chance to stem the tide of the saurian swarms. Exosuit pilots, otherwise known as exofighters, are in high demand. Take the exofighter aptitude test and join the ranks of Aibius's heroic pilots in their fight to stave off the extinction of the human race. 【EXOSUITS】 Exosuits are cutting-edge powered suits developed to combat the dinosaur threat. Based on their range of abilities, exosuits are primarily categorized into one of three roles: assault, tank, and support. Exofighters can change exosuits at any time, even during battle, by performing a suit change. Take advantage of this flexibility to alter your team composition on the fly and complete your objectives. ROLES ASSAULT Assault exosuits focus on dealing damage to enemies with close, medium, or long-range attacks. Although exact loadouts differ, each assault exosuit is equipped with weapons and abilities tailored to its effective combat range. Use the best weapon for the situation and eradicate whatever stands in your way. TANK Tank exosuits specialize in protecting their allies by drawing enemy attacks and absorbing damage. Whether they're holding back a massive horde or stopping relentless dinosaur attacks, tank exosuits will form your team's first line of defense. SUPPORT Support exosuits use a variety of abilities to ensure the team's survival. While the ability to repair allied exosuits is most common, support exosuits are also equipped with a range of buffing and debuffing abilities. Support exosuits use these abilities to improve a team's combat effectiveness and accomplish objectives even faster. RIGS Rigs are additional pieces of equipment for exosuits. Rigs grant exosuits additional abilities, but only one may be equipped at a time. For example, the Zephyr exosuit excels at close quarters combat but has trouble with foes that attack from long-distance. Equipping it with the Cannon rig will enable Zephyr to use a long-range laser. Or, equip Roadblock with the Aid rig to provide healing and create a formidable front line of defense. Players can experiment with different combinations of rigs and exosuits to find their ideal playstyle. Both rigs and exosuits can be changed at any time. 【DINO SURVIVAL】 In Dino Survival, two squads of five race to complete objectives. Teams must follow Leviathan's directives and complete the mission before their rivals to win. Some situations pit players against one another in direct combat, and others require players to band together with their rivals to take down a major foe. In Dino Survival, the missions change based on players' progression through the game. The experience will be different with each match, even in matches with familiar surroundings and objectives. Players can unlock story sequences by playing Dino Survival and also earn rewards such as experience points to increase player and exosuit levels. DINOSAURS Dinosaurs, once the most fearsome and powerful creatures in the animal kingdom, are no longer history. However, traveling through spacetime via the vortexes has mutated these beasts and ramped up their ferocity to all-new heights. Humanity must rely on its ingenuity and its most powerful weapons – exosuits – to respond to this crisis. NEOSAURS Neosaurs are mutated dinosaurs with unusual appearances and abilities. Dinosaurs are imbued with a highly unstable energy when they cross through the vortex barrier after passing through spacetime. This energy is responsible for the ferocious transformation many dinosaurs undergo. Neosaurs possess an extremely high concentration of this energy, granting them unusual appearances, abilities, and attacks.\",\n",

With all the attributes of a full-fledged strategy game, you control your colony by writing script that operates 24/7 in the single persistent open world filled by other players on par with you. Your colony can harvest resources, build units, conquer territory, trade with other colonies. As you conquer more territory, your influence in the game world grows, as well as your abilities to expand your footprint. But beware, multiple players aiming for the same territory may lead to conflict! Screeps is developed for people with programming skills. Unlike some other RTS games, your units in Screeps can react to events without your participation – provided that you have programmed them properly.

Many kinds of units, base building, mining resources, territory control, economy, manufacturing, transporting, logistics, trading—all the attributes of a real strategy game which you need to program! The better your scripts, the better your game—irrespective of the time played. Your creeps will mine, build, defend, and conquer as you just work, sleep, or walk your dog. Only basic programming skills are required. However, if you are a pro developer, now is the chance to put your skills to the limit! Edit your scripts from the in-game editor, or using your favorite external IDE. Other languages are supported via WebAssembly : C/C++, Rust, TypeScript, Go, C#, F#, Kotlin, Swift, D, Pascal, Zig, the list is growing. Permanent MMO access with 20 CPU limit included in the starter package. Unlock your full CPU in your account on the official server by purchasing a Lifetime CPU unlock or an in-game CPU Unlock consumable item (can be bought by in-game credits). If you don't want to buy an unlock, that's fine—there is a standalone CPU-limited world shard where you can compete with other 'CPU-locked' players on equal terms. Host your own server, modify games rules and play with your friends via LAN or on the Internet. The server is an open source project . The game is slow-paced (from 2 seconds to 5 seconds per game tick depending on a world shard where you start playing), since it allows you to debug your scripts in the real-time world. You can use your private server to develop and test with fast pace (up to 10 game ticks per second).\",\n",

Explore the colorful future metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, meeting a huge cast of fascinating characters and solving a far-reaching mystery. Think carefully about your choices, because you never know how they will affect this dynamic, branching narrative further down the line. The world is changing. Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital assistants, are exerting greater control over people’s lives. Some are terrified by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent it. A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine—not a simulation of life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being—and the technical genius who created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you? Old-school, cutting-edge - Classic point-and-click adventuring inspired by the likes of Gabriel Knight and Snatcher is melded with modern branching storytelling that delves into identity, individuality, and what it means to be human. People of the future - Get to know a diverse cross-section of Neo-SF’s population, brought to life by some of the best voice talent working in games today, including Melissa Hutchison and Dave Fennoy ( The Walking Dead ), Erin Yvette ( Oxenfree ), Austin Creed (WWE’s Xavier Woods ), and internet stars Jim Sterling ( Jimquisition ) and SungWon Cho ( ProZD ). High tech nostalgia - The city of Neo-San Francisco is rendered in beautiful pixel art, and your adventure is accompanied by a catchy low-fi electronic synth soundtrack. Solve the mystery - Enjoy over ten hours of adventure gaming goodness, featuring exploration, dynamic branching conversations, multiple endings, and many challenges to overcome. The definitive PC edition - Since its launch two years ago, the team has made many improvements and additions to an already amazing game, making this the ultimate version. Additions have included new characters and voice performers, additional facial animations, Japanese language support, and the “Endless Christmas” extended epilogue that allows you to hang out with your favorite Neo-SF locals.

You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.\",\n",

       " \"Heart of the Woods is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends life and death. Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves. A part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend. She’s professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt. For the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse. Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to. One of the world’s most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. She’s brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether it’s from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos. A loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeld’s mayor, Morgan is...different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, she’s known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village. However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that there’s something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and she’s not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots.

       " \"Set in the 90's, sometime after the fall of the USSR, Thunder Tier One is a realistic top-down shooter where you join an elite special operations team tasked with stopping a terrorist organization. In 4-player co-op or solo with AI teammates, players must carefully select their gear and utilize all their tactical skills to complete each operation successfully. STORY DRIVEN CAMPAIGN A paramilitary-turned terrorist organization known as SBR have carried out a series of attacks on civilian targets in the Eastern European nation of Salobia. Thunder has been deployed to locate SBR leader Marko Antonov and put an end to his campaign of terror. Designed to be played in 4-player co-op, the 9-mission campaign takes you through various scenarios where teamwork and communication is key to completing each operation successfully. In solo mode, you will be joined by three AI teammates who will react intelligently to each situation they face. You can also take charge and issue them with a variety of individual and group commands to ensure they are executing your plan. How much you manage them is completely up to you. WEAPON &amp; LOADOUT CUSTOMISATION You decide exactly what you take into each mission, and can choose from a wide variety of weapons and attachments, ammo type (and amount), armor, grenades and tools - you can even choose which camouflage pattern to have on your clothing. The same goes for your AI teammates, you have full control over what they use and carry. The gear you select will depend on your strategy for the mission. Coordinate with your teammates and go fully suppressed with IR lasers and NVGs for a stealth approach, or go in guns blazing with the heaviest armor and a backpack filled to the brim with extra ammo and frags. Just make sure you have the right tools to get the job done. REALISTIC GUNPLAY Thunder Tier One isn't your typical top-down shooter and it's not as simple as staying behind cover and clicking on heads. You need to use both your knowledge and the wealth of weapons at your disposal to be successful. Each weapon has unique attributes such as handling, rate of fire, muzzle velocity, effective range and accuracy. These characteristics, combined with the type of ammo loaded, will determine how accurate your shots are, how much damage is dealt against armored and unarmored targets, whether the round penetrates an object being used for cover and the damage and trajectory of the round if it does. And ultimately, they’ll determine whether you are able to effectively complete your mission objectives. ADDITIONAL PVP &amp; PVE MODES Thunder Tier One has four challenging multiplayer modes to test your skill set. Exfil : a 4v4 mode where the attacking team is tasked with exfiltrating a package within the time limit and the defending team with preventing it by any means possible. Advance and Secure : a 4v4 mode where the teams go head-to-head to try and secure a series of sectors and claim victory. Death Match : the free-for-all classic with up to 8 players. Domination : a PVE mode where a team of up to four players race against the clock to secure a series of checkpoints, disarm explosives, and defend against counter-attacks.

       " \"Unreal Tournament is the original King of the Hill in the frag-or-be-fragged multiplayer gaming world. As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave gamers more than they ever expected. Novice Mode - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp. The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins... Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real. Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. UBrowser - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the 'Play Online' button and then selecting a server from the list, the game is on. Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be 'attached' to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely. © 2000, Epic Games, Inc.

       " \"Explore, fight, craft and build your defenses! Enjoy a unique and innovative game: • Strategy : survive massive attacks each night by building strong walls and placing turrets wisely. • Physics : build wisely or your structures will collapse! And you will need them to defend your base, or build bridges and high towers to access remote locations. • Water cycle : rain, infiltration, underground rivers and lakes... be careful during the heavy rains, or you could be surprised by a sudden water level rise! You are a representative of the CRAFT &amp; Co company. You are selling automated fabrication tools across the galaxy when your spacecraft crashes into a hostile planet. Use the tools you sell and the local resources to build up all of what you'll need to survive and eventually be able to escape the planet. New content! • Play classic solo or multiplayer co-op , or try the custom game modes: Under the Sea (start in a cave under a huge ocean!), Sky World (a random world composed of hundreds of flying islands), or Base Defense (no exploration, only base building and defense). • Activate the Hazardous Events option to trigger various surprises like Meteor Shower, Rain Flood, Earthquake, Volcano Eruption or even a Sharkstorm! • Enjoy Creative Mode and produce all items for free. This includes cheated items and tools to modify terrain or even create water and lava! Gameplay: • Fun from the start : no awfully slow digging, so you can concentrate on the exploration, fights and strategy. • Game's final objective : you must build a rocket ship to escape the planet. • Strategy survival : the game is a survival game in a strategic meaning. No hunger needs, the whole point of the game is to survive to the massive attacks each night. And to do that, you will have to explore the world to gather resources and craft your defenses. Fights: • No swords, magic or flying clown monsters here! It's a consistent science-fiction world , with fast and fun laser guns fights! • Intelligent monsters : they will find the best path to attack your defenses. And be careful: even if they can't move through walls, they can still destroy them! • Difficulty progression : only the species of monsters you have already killed before attack during the night (they must have taken ill!). So you can progress at your own pace and choose when you are ready to move forward and fight stronger monsters. • AI companion : your crashed ship contains an AI that survived and will give you useful advices (or not!). Build him a drone so he can follow you and even help you fight the monsters! World Simulation: • Huge world with global real-time simulation of the environment, physics, water cycle and lighting. • Electricity : build solar panels or functional hydroelectric generators to power your base’s most advanced items! • Plants simulation : plants naturally grow and spread if their life-conditions are met. Create some farms with artificial sun lamps and irrigation. • Procedurally generated world : Major areas locations are specific to benefit from a logical game progression, but detailed layout of surface, caverns, ores, etc. are unique at each playthrough. Crafting and Building: • Crafting : You dig minerals, harvest plants and kill some monsters and bosses in order to craft better items and defenses. But the digging is really fast, your inventory space is infinite and all crafting recipes are displayed, so you don’t waste all your time on grinding or wikis and can concentrate on setting up better defenses. • Base construction : You build a fortress, not a holiday house. So you won't find hundreds of flowerpots or tapestries, but rather turrets, strong walls and useful machines. Remember the Starship Troopers or Aliens movies atmosphere!\",\n",

       " '“Charge set”, my Alpha Team leader said. Not knowing what lay in wait for us behind the door, I commanded, “Burn it” into the radio. “Burning”, he replied. Sliding his finger into the pull ring of the ignition system, he pushed the pin in, turned it a quarter turn, and pulled. The night was no longer silent as the sound of shredding timber filled the night. Windows shattered and pieces of glass fell to the ground. The walls around me shook. Where a door once stood, only smoke remained. Like water bursting forth from a dam, men flowed into the unknown. --- from “Violence of Action” by Marty Skovlund The long awaited sequel to the hit tactics game Door Kickers, Task Force North brings you the best portrayal of modern Close Quarters Combat and Tactics in a video game. Now available in Early Access! Door Kickers 2 is a top down strategy and tactics game about using intelligence assets and controlling Special Operation Units in daring raids to neutralize and capture terrorists in the fictional country of Nowheraki, Middle East. True to the violent and dynamic nature of combat in the region, the game models deadly threats and technologies such as booby traps, suicide bombers, RPGs and concealed insurgents - while handing you new toys such as Light Machine Guns for suppressive fire, drone reconnaissance, night vision goggles and wall breaching charges . Adding further to the roster of improvements, you can now choose the unit to deploy for any mission. The United States Army Rangers make for the initial deployment option, but soon we will reveal other - distinct but equally cool units. The choice will not be simply one of skins and weapons, but also come with distinct playing style and abilities we will reveal further down development road.

       " 'Vagrus is an award-winning roleplaying game with a narrative focus, open-world exploration, and strong elements of strategy. The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and dangerous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures. A vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that ended up devastating the realms. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, swarming with twisted monsters, and haunted by roaming undead even after long centuries of rebuilding. A large selection of stories make up the game’s narrative in the form of events and quests. The choices you make in these often affect your companions and the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, follow rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge. Engage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous. Use a wide range of character skills as well as your own leadership-related abilities to succeed. Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance in these challenging engagements. Journeys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and your crew’s vigor effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be managed well to optimize their effectiveness. A wide variety of companions can work for you in versatile caravan roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, treasure hunter, or beast handler. Each companion comes with unique combat skills, background stories, and personal quest lines that can upgrade them further when you complete them. Ally yourself with mighty factions that shape the Riven Realms with their influence on commerce, brutal wars, and constant scheming. From prosperous Trading Houses to criminal syndicates and religious organizations, these groups offer powerful rewards and boons to those loyal to their cause. But take heed - befriending a faction will more than likely antagonize others.',\n",

While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet.

What are the creative motive, game plot and game mechanism of the Red Obsidian Remnant? Which games do you use for reference in the process of designing? As our first independent game, we choose the Roguelike dungeon type, because it is relatively well controlled. All the game experience is concentrated in a single hour of the game time, so that we can be more focused to make it rich and harmonious. Faced with the emerging of more and more roguelike dungeon games, what we can think of is to combine our game with ACT in order to make a difference. We hope the finally added plot can make the game more complete though the story is not the main part of the game. Speaking of reference, we’ve seen a lot of good works and I think that encourages us to make our own. So, you may feel intimacy while playing the game. Since we all have been more or less influenced by Falcom, I think our game style is somewhat similar to that. In the aspect of Roguelike elements, we borrow a lot from The Binding of Isaac. I am an old player of the retro arcade games. I played a lot of SNK’s classical fighting games and the Last Blade is my favorite. I like to play on the arcade fighting platform occasionally, to recall the past. What elements of the Red Obsidian Remnant do you think are interesting and innovative? In your opinion, what’s the core of the dungeon exploration roguelike game? It’s our first time to make a Roguelike game, but we played a lot and we learn from others. The Roguelike game is the concentration of the long-term RPG, in which players have to experience a time to develop, and to develop changing routines in order to maintain freshness in each play. The Red Obsidian Remnant is an action game and its fighting routine changes reflect more in moves. Besides, the equipment in the Red Obsidian Remnant is the key to influencing the development of the role. So we let the roles carry more weapons. The moves of each weapon can be used alternately and the combination of different weapons can directly form a fighting style. This can be counted as a solution, which just solved problems in the design. I think rules are born under various restrictions. What are the characteristics of the monster system in the game? How to keep the balance of the monster system and the difficulty of the game? As the action game, its basic part is to design monsters with different moves, based on which we add monster differentiation system. The differentiated monster will be attached around with spinning balls and each kind of the balls carries various effects, which may cause the monster explode or parasitize, split after death. You can simply do the math. Besides, there exist no monsters with pure armors since the armor will lead to the invalidity of the ACT basic system after the attack, and the failure to attack consistently, which will make you feel suck. Therefore, the characteristic of armors here is only adopted as part of the monster’s moves. As for the difficulty and the relationships among monsters, we will enhance the AI initiative of the monsters, times of differentiation and the probability of the emergence of dangerous houses in the high difficulty mode. The premise is to maintain the basic value of monsters. Sina Weibo',\n",

       " \"Unreal Tournament 2004 is a multiplayer first person shooter that combines the kill-or-be-killed experience of gladiatorial combat with cutting-edge technology. Ten game modes - both team-based and 'every man for himself' -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas. Assault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world. Onslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments, here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks. Vehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction. Levels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament. Weapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll. New Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill. New Technology - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor, delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before.\",\n",

       " \"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs. Story The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. Combat Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics. Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar. Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual. On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle. A Streaming Open World Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. Multiplayer Mayhem 4v4 'skirmish' multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play). Music The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.\",\n",

The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne , and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like Deus Ex . Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city , where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities. In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.

In the distant future, the power of science and technology has ushered a new age to the human race. Space and time have become irrelevant thanks to virtual reality. A new kind of supercomputer has been developed – a machine whose superior artificial intelligence and computing capability will push humanity even further. There is only one problem: there isn’t enough energy in the whole planet to feed this machine. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that humanity needs.

Neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, gaseous and rocky planets… There is a big and varied universe out there, waiting for you to gather all its resources. Every playthrough will be unique: your universe will be procedurally generated every time you start a new game. There will be different types and distribution of stars, planets and resources. Will you manage to thrive and build your Spheres, no matter what the universe throws at you? As a space engineer, you are expected to design your interstellar factory and production lines, not to micromanage every small package going back and forth. You have to transport materials from one planet to another, forming interstellar transport teams that gather resources and bring them to where they are needed. Then, your resources can be transported between facilities through conveyor belts, and you’ve got the technology to help your buildings fit the grid automatically during the construction process. You’ve got the best tools COSMO can afford to build a massive-scale automated production line – the most efficient one ever seen in the universe!

       " \"Simplicity to perfection. To be played in bursts. By design, there is no story. Only crazy kung-fu. You're surrounded, outnumbered and have to use any weapon you can get your hands on to dismantle your opponents in a flurry of kung fu. That's the essence of OFDP2, the world's fastest brawler. It features the original OFDP's unique two-button mechanics which we've spent the last five years perfecting. Speed and precision are key in this whirlwind fighting frenzy, as players maintain control over the 26 different unlockable skills, frenetic gameplay, and classic kung fu-inspired animations. ATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT We want to show that a fighting game can be complex without cumbersome button combinations. Once players complete the tutorial levels and learn the basics, they'll see that this is the most intense two-button game ever made. With 1000 different animations available, literally, anything is possible—particularly when players unlock each of the 26 available skills. Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve. Seeing the game with all 26 skills is a spectacle unique to OFDP2. We built this game as a palette cleanser between other games in your library. It was designed to deliver a quick hit of adrenalin as fast as possible. You can't get a feel for the gameplay from watching videos. The flow of combat is something we spent years tweaking. It's what makes OFDP2 unique. Only by playing it will this become clear. That's why it's important to us that you TRY THE DEMO out before you consider purchasing this game. *You can turn the announcer on or off in the options. *64 bit operating systems only. *Windows 7 might have issues playing the few video files in the game.

       " 'Three hundred years have passed since the Shadow Wars have ravaged Keldonia and the world of Aer, and the struggles of the past have long since faded into legends. In the Highlands of Fareach, Clans of Barbarian warriors have eked out a living in the harsh northern climate, constantly feuding with each other and raiding the wealthier Borderland towns. Fed up with these constant attacks, the Borderland Clans called on the Empire for help – a powerful realm controlling the land from the Scarlett Mountains to Cynehelm Valley and the Hoarwood. The Western Imperial Legion was sent to face the highland raiders, and with the help of the Borderland clans Iseal and Machnar, killed High King Brendan in the battle of Wyrm’s Pass. A treaty was signed that forbade any clan from crossing into the Borderlands in return for peace. Since then, there has been no High King to unite the Clans, and they fell into quarrelling and raiding amongst themselves. In these dark times your clan has been led by Falir One-Eye, a warrior of great renown. You are his son and designated heir, and you are eager to prove your mettle to the Clan Council and your father… The Legacy Fantasy General II: Invasion is the reimagination of the strategy game classic from the 90s! Armies once again draw battle-lines on the war-torn land of Keldonia, and a new generation of commanders will test their bravery and tactics against each other. Fantasy wargaming is back! The Battles True to the tradition of the original game, Fantasy General II is all about turn-based battles. Lead over 75 different unique unit types, including powerful heroes. Take into consideration terrain, weapons and armour, magical effects, morale, and the balance of forces, make a plan, execute it, and vanquish your enemy, forging your reputation as a savage war-leader. The Campaign Battle after battle, you will need to make decisions and develop your army. The young clan members will need to be trained, and as they gain enough experience, even the greenest recruits can be turned into champions. But beware: costly victories can be worse than a defeat… when battle-hardened units perish, so does their progression and experience. Each unit comes with their specific abilities, arms and armour, and they can be equipped with magic artefacts you find during battle and upgraded with gold and resources that you need to plunder from your enemy. The Clans A confederation of autonomous hill-land tribes, who value their independence and will fight fiercely for it. Field axemen, berserkers, spearmaidens, trolls and shamans, summon ancestor spirits and mighty elementals or train nimble stag riders and deadly werebears or recruit mercenaries from longbowmen to centaurs. The Empire The most powerful realm on the face of Aer. Face the mighty Legions of the Empire and their magical creations from dragon cannons to golems as well as the Undead hordes they bring to battle, or fight harpies, lizard people and great dragons on your way. The World The world of Aer is filled with beauty and wonders. From the cold, magic-rich highlands of Fareach, home to the player’s Barbarian Clans, to the Borderlands with their fertile river valleys and deep woods where witches and monsters still roam free; from the Sunken Land, submerged through a great Cataclysm and filled with treacherous swamp and Lizardfolk, to the refined and temperate Empire to the South, home to wondrous cities and built upon undead labour. Your campaign will see you fight across very different battlefields, requiring variable tactics and army composition.',\n",

       " \"The Witch’s House, originally released in 2012, falls within the tradition of Japanese horror RPGs with heavy emphasis on puzzle-solving and jump scares. Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch’s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror. The Witch’s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch’s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. A horror atmosphere wherein players solve puzzles based on clues found in the house. Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised. Sudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep. Items must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves. Fixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat). Game pads are supported and recommended. Head phones *strongly* recommended. Hello. I'm Fummy, creator of The Witch's House MV. I'm happy to announce that we're finally ready to release the game. The Witch's House MV is an RPG Maker MV remake of the original game, which was released back in 2012. We remade all the graphics, including map tiles and character sprites, and worked hard to enhance the atmosphere and 2D beauty in The Witch's House. It took us five times as many hours to create this version, but we feel like we've finally managed to satisfy ourselves. Aside from graphical improvements, we also added two new difficulty settings that was not present in the free version. The first difficulty setting is a more accessible one that allows you to instantly retry. The other difficulty setting is a more difficult one which is only unlocked by those who manage to reach the game's true ending. 'The normal difficulty isn't enough to satisfy me...' 'I'm not averse to instantly dying upon reaching new areas.' If either of these describe you, then we recommend you give this new difficulty a try. You also may be able to uncover some new story bits concerning 'her'... The world of The Witch's House has been reborn anew, and we sincerely hope you'll all enjoy it. My name is Dan Stern and I’m the Scholar of the First Deal at DANGEN Entertainment (sounds fancy, but it means I work with the devs to get their games released so you can play them). Japan has a longer tradition in 16-bit horror games because of the variety of games that was released on the Super Famicom. But that wasn’t something I experienced because of growing up in the West. It wasn’t until I discovered The Witch’s House some years ago that I learned 16-bit games can scare me just as well as high-res AAA games made in 3D. I learned that even in pixel-art, horror is possible; it just depends on the creator’s mastery of atmosphere and timing. Fummy-san absolutely has that mastery and as silly as it sounds, I’ve never had so much fun dying a lot in a video game. I was ecstatic to find out that not only is there a remaster of my favorite indie horror classic, but that DANGEN could help to get that game in front of fans that I know will love it. Playing The Witch’s House MV feels like a totally new experience and I’m sure you’ll have fun with the new content after you finish your first playthrough. Cheers!\",\n",

       " 'The fascinating multiverse of Tad Williams’ critically acclaimed Otherland novels transformed into a full scale MMORPG with a new storyline to discover. Otherland: Next is the next step for the Otherland MMORPG expanding the content, revamping the UI and adding lots of other improvements. The multiverse of Otherland: Next consists of a multitude of game worlds ranging from SciFi to Medieval with an incredible diversity in environments paired with gorgeous graphics delivered by the Unreal Engine. The idea behind Otherland: Next is a virtual network of simulated worlds with something for everyone, ranging from the futuristic Lambda Mall to the medieval 8Squared, a steampunk oriented Mars or the Asia-themed 5Isle. Become part of the Otherland network and experience these story-rich worlds by helping their inhabitants fight the NeoGrail set on their destruction. Otherland: Next features a wide range of mechanics and activities such as challenges, dungeons, PvP battlegrounds, trading, player housing and clan areas just to mention a few. More about Otherland: Next Otherland: Next comes with 4 classes, each of them able to switch between two roles: The Warrior can be either a tank or a damage dealer with just a switch of a stance. Specialized in close quarter combat and high endurance, the Warrior is an excellent choice for melee combat. The Assassin’s domain on the other hand is staying in the shadows, picking fights on his own terms and unleashing massive damage in a short amount of time. While rather fragile, the Assassin class can switch to a tanking role using avoidance rather than sheer endurance. The Marksman keeps his enemies at range utilizing bows and firearms and is the supreme ranged combat class of the game. With a switch of a stance he can also aid his team with healing and buffs. The Energizer uses large energy weapons and is the supreme healer in the game. Energizers can also quickly switch their role to a very capable ranged damage dealer. Additionally, the Social Class offers the unique option to jump right to Lambda Mall, the main hub of the game, to customize the character and socialize with other players. Players of the Social Class can later choose to switch this character to one of the main classes and experience story, combat and all other game features with one of the four main classes. Otherland: Next offers in-depth character customization starting with the character’s look itself all the way to gearing up. Here you’ll find one of the most advanced and detailed crafting systems, that allows you to define individual stats of items you craft. Those items then can be customized further by adding mods into sockets or even use special items to change stats on already crafted items. Players can also craft or buy costumes which will apply the looks to the character while keeping the stats of the equipped gear set. There are even vanity outfits following a wide range of visual themes, allowing you to further customize the looks of your characters. The customization is not just about looks. With a wide selection of skills for each class you also get to build your character the way that best fits your playstyle.',\n",

       " \"Homestead (Singleplayer Mode) Grandpa has passed down his old farm to you. Help nurture it back to life in the new Homestead mode for Heat. Homestead is a new Single Player mode, in which you build an amazing farm by day, and go to sleep at night. It was inspired by games such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, but we wanted to take it in a different direction, mixing in many survival elements. You can pick from 10 different scenarios. Each scenario has a different starting homestead, starting equipment, and some have special conditions. The game saves when you sleep at night, you can load up old saves, and it supports full admin commands. Heat (Multiplayer Mode) Survive the wilderness, build a home, raise a family, and expand your territory. Gain power as President, deliver justice as Sheriff, fight for your tribe as Chief, or show some southern hospitality as Governor. Begin your new life in 19th century America. Heat is an online multiplayer survival mode for up to 40 players. Environment There are 20 unique biomes in Heat spread out over a 67km2 world, each with its own sub-biomes to explore. We developed a unique way to create dense forest floors which requires players to clear the land in order to build. Explore vast and diverse landscapes ranging from the cold mountainous peaks to the tropical seashores, and from the harsh deserts to the muggy swamplands. Built from the roots up using real-world photogrammetric data, experience next generation graphics in both variety and detail. Seasons &amp; Dynamic Weather The game world visually updates in real time based on the season you are in. Play through all four seasons. Enjoy the crisp colors of fall, or the long snowy days of winter. Prepare your homestead for the winter time by keeping ample food supply as you cannot farm during this season. Wear some insulated clothes, keep them dry, and light some furnaces to keep warm. Check the Newspaper for a weekly weather forecast, as its important to know when the rains will come. Towns, Merchants, and Outlaws Visit the towns of Washington, Tombstone, and Sacayo. You can buy and sell at them, and each town has some unique goods for sale in which you can trade between towns for a profit. Merchants sell items you cannot buy from the shipping bin catalogue, and are a convenient way to sell your items when traveling. Get a good nights rest at the local Inn, and deposit some money at the bank for safe keeping. You can also gift a dowry to any townsfolk in order to buy their affection. Fast travel between towns by buying a ticket for the train at the train stations. However, be careful to obey the law and not shoot at townsfolk and merchants. By doing so, you will be labelled an Outlaw, receive Heat, and have the law chase you down. Stockpiles and Shipping Bin We introduce a new concept in stockpiles. Heavy goods require physical space for storage, so while you can still store light goods in your small containers, wood, stone, ore, and other heavy materials must be stored in large stockpiles. This gives players a visual representation of their goods, and since stockpiles take up space, thought must also go into defending them. Each player also can craft a stash container which accepts a mix of light and heavy goods to help get them started, but these come with limited slots. Players may also build shipping bins. These can be placed in your base and you may sell harvested, crafted, and farmed goods in them for in-game currency. Shipping bins also come with a catalog with which you may order items using your hard earned in-game currency. Farming and Cooking Get farm-ready with the hoe, watering can, sprinklers, and scythe. Each tool has its own set of tiers, and there are a variety of crops that may be planted. Fertilizers are also an important consideration for the aspiring farmer. Once your crops have matured, harvest them and bring them to the cooking stations in order to produce a wide range of food types. You may also decide to sell your crops in your shipping bin and buy more seed for your farming operation. Building &amp; Crafting Construct your new home - From a quick hobo shack, a rustic cabin deep in the woods, a refined mansion, or a giant fortress. Craft and place walls, floors, doors, windows, furniture, and other fixtures individually by your own design. Process goods with sawmills, tanneries, smelters and other workstations. These materials will aid in crafting at various workstations and purchasing blueprints. Protect your establishment with well-placed cannons and strategically planned fortifications using massive rampart building sections. Mounts, Livestock &amp; Wildlife The landscape is populated by a variety of American wildlife, all of which can be hunted - assuming you are not hunted yourself. But they can also be tamed, whether as livestock or as a beloved pet. You may ride tamed horses, as well as other animals - even bears! Survival Gather and hunt for food to keep yourself strong. Collect a variety of raw materials from nature for use in crafting, building and refinement. Once you have the basics of sticks and stones down, you may begin your journey towards establishing yourself as an industrious and powerful colony or even President of the United States. There will be struggles and fallbacks along the way. Your character may be killed and robbed, where everything he or she has equipped is taken. Your property may be broken into and looted by a gang of raiders lead by other players. But with plenty of resources and defensive tactics at your disposal, raiders will be in for a serious fight. Go Forth and Multiply Start a family with other players or NPCs. Players can give birth to a newborn. The newborn grows to become a baby, the baby then grows up to be a child, the child eventually becomes an adult. A second option is to adopt from an orphanage by purchasing a baby basket in the shipping catalog. The baby will be inside the basket delivered to you. Adoption is very expensive, but provides a guaranteed outcome. Your children are a mix of the visual DNA of the two parents. Babies, children, and adults will need to feed and stay hydrated. Once your kids become adults you can equip them with outfits, gear, and weapons. They can help protect you when you are online. Road Building Build roads in the game or create pads around your base using the rake tool. Players may build roads using a variety of materials ranging from wood chips, dirt, sand, gravel, pavement and more. Players may also place freshly cut lawn for a well-kept look. Seats of Power As President, you own the Whitehouse, a section of land south of the monument, one intern, a golden gun, and two secret service NPCs. You also get to set and collect a President’s land tax. Players may also become the Sheriff, Chief, or Governor. Each are given their own areas, items, and NPCs. Combat &amp; Capture On your adventures you'll encounter other players who may or may not be friendly. Likewise, you may not be so friendly either given these tactics at your disposal: - Fill 'em full of lead with plenty of handguns, rifles, shotguns and other firearms to craft. - Take the more silent approach with bows and javelins that will leave your foes looking like a pin cushion. - Get up in their face with melee instruments, or beat them down with some good old blunt force. - Capture, restrain, and put them into your interrogation dungeon with its various contraptions. - Messily dismember with a well-placed strike or shotgun blast. - Blow them to smithereens with artillery cannon fire and TNT. - Experience the thrill of vigilante justice from either a first or third person perspective. Character Customization Choose your gender and tune your appearance to your liking, including variations in skin tone, height and girth, the shape of facial features, hair or lack thereof, and voice tone.\",\n",

You can get to know the “intimate” side of the characters from the classic Japanese tale of the 47 Ronin while playing a visual novel ー all without any of the dangly or rough bits of the original! This visual novel has been adapted from a sound novel based on the actual historical facts of the Ako incident. In adapting the story to visual novel format, most of the main characters of the 47 Ronin have been turned into females, and parts of the core story have been polished into a lighter literary style that also incorporates fantasy elements. The story goes something like this… On the 14th day of the third month of Genroku 14 (1701 CE ), an incident occurred involving the ruler of the Ako Domain, Lord Asano Takumi No Mikami shedding the blood of Kira Kousuke No Suke in the Corridor of the Pines in Edo Palace. This incident that would later become known in Japan as the famous Ako incident. Upon hearing of this incident on the same day, the fifth shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi , became enraged. It was ruled that that very same day, Lord Asano should be sentenced to seppuku, after which his lands were to be scattered and his house broken up. Meanwhile, Kira Kousuke No Suke received no no rebuke whatsoever, going against the tradition set by the first Shogun of punishing both parties in a fight. Unable to comprehend this harsh and shocking punishment, the loyal Samurai retainers of Ako start to move to restore honour to their master by commencing a vendetta against Lord Kira . Meanwhile, Fukami Suguha is transported from present day Japan to the Edo-period Ako domain, where he gets to know the Ako Ronin. What will become of Suguha as he throws himself to the mercy of the cogs of history, and will he ever be able to return to his own time?',\n",

They don't provide any guidance. They don't give a f*ck. I have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don't know how. I've never been able to figure out why I do what I do. Not really. No more time to think. I have to go. Here's the deal You are Neil Conrad, CDI agent. Awoken by the news of a murder, you rush into a case that will soon turn your life and the whole solar system upside down. Ask questions, collect evidence, and put the pieces together until the ugly truth reveals itself... or not. No takebacks The story branches and ends based on your actions. There's no going back. Sure, you can rush your way to the end – if you don't mind paying the price. Play your cards right, and you might make it out alive. How far will you go? Some questions don't have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect your family? Will you endanger a loved one in exchange for public safety? Will you keep the peace or reveal the horrible, world-shattering truth? Hungry for Point &amp; Click Adventure?

       " \"Angels Fall First is a first person combined-arms sci-fi wargame. AFF focuses on team-oriented tactical gameplay and objective-based scenarios with a high degree of replayability, featuring: Wide selection of weapons and tools, ground vehicles and spacecraft to fight with. Diverse combat opportunities - assume point to clear a building, hunt with a frigate wolfpack as a lineship captain, issue orders from the bridge of your battleship. Fully operational and pilotable capital ships with playable interiors. Unique combination of spaceship and infantry combat - board spacestations, shipyards and vessels to capture or destroy them from the inside. Dogfighting using space interceptors and bombers, launched from capital ships and stations. Gameplay mechanics designed as a mix of modern elements (customization, loadouts, persistence) and inspirations from classic shooters (frantic, fast-paced firefights). Commander mode for issuing orders to your squadmates and teammates. Full AI support - all scenarios can be played both offline and online identically, supporting up to 64 players or bots filling in for the players if required. Rich science fiction universe setting. Another space game? Well, we've been doing this a long time - AFF has been a rich universe of fiction and art since 2005. We made a Homeworld mod, and kept building from there. Work started on an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, but was then ported over to UT3 in 2007, culminating in a 3rd place grand prize in 2009's MakeSomethingUnreal contest. Angels Fall First as a standalone game is, for us, a mission to enable the player to do as much as possible in a vast environment - whilst still retaining the focussed, fun experience of match based FPS games. Way back in the back-whens, we loved Tie Fighter. A little later on, we loved Battlefield. We waited patiently for the game which would inevitably unite the vast scale and spacefights with the close and personal firefights and thunderous vehicle battles... But it never really appeared. Many games came close, but there was always some part missing. You couldn’t get out of your spaceship, you couldn’t get into your spaceship, you had big spaceships but you couldn’t run around in them, you could run around in your big spaceship but you couldn’t fly it and so on and so forth and gahd damMIT! Where was our spacefight groundfight game? So, we set ourselves to work. AFF exists because it MUST exist. Only in AFF can you spawn in your crew quarters, run to the bay watching the space fight out of the windows, launch a dropship, fight through the defenders to the enemy flagship, breach the hull, run and gun your way to the bridge and SHOOT THE ENEMY CAPTAIN IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. Calm Down! Ok. But it's this slightly twitchy passion which has driven us to create such a monster. We grew old making this, and we got grumpy watching everyone else release their cool games or whatever. We're from a time when games were about blowing stuff up for points and glory and now FINALLY we want to go out there and share this crazy passion with all of you!\",\n",
       " \"Planet Nomads is a singleplayer sci-fi sandbox game of survival on alien planets through block-style building. You are a lone astronaut scientist crash-landing on a strangely captivating planet. Keeping your wit together and securing your basic survival needs that include food, water and building material is the best start towards figuring out a way out of this messy situation. Planet Nomads delivers a unique gaming experience by combining building, survival and exploration together to make you feel like a true survivor. Building Building is the cornerstone of Planet Nomads. What you build determines your survival chances and increases your action radius. Building helps you to progress further and uncover advanced materials. Close to a hundred blocks await to let you create nearly anything your imagination can come up with. Exploration You may have explored your immediate surrounding, but a couple kilometers North or South, things are radically different. Multiple biomes cover the planet from pole to pole depending on the climate. Sandy engine blends the biomes naturally, making sure the journey to the North pole is an epic and everchanging adventure. Survival Surviving on an inhabited planet is no easy task, but with careful planning, caution and a healthy amount of curiosity, you can do it. As long as you overcome poisonous plants and curious beasts, avoid being slashed to pieces, frozen to death, eaten alive, starved and generally ended. Planet Nomads has been successfully Kickstarted, is now going through its Early Access, and it's being developed and improved together with our growing Nomadic family. You are most welcome to join us. How can a life of a Nomad look like? Day 17 Things have changed radically since my crash-landing. During the first days, I was hardly able to get food. Securing every meal was a life or death struggle back then, while now I have greenhouses to produce food for me. The planet felt strangely Earth-like at first, with atmosphere composition close enough to ours so that the suit filters have no problem processing it for me to breath. Then one day I saw a pack of creatures that looked like some kind of armored gorillas. I was watching them for a while when the biggest one saw me. It stood on its legs and started thumping its chest. I got the message loud and clear and quickly departed. Day 21 I have a good thing going. I started growing all of my food. I've built a rover and use it to collect resources from nearby mining spots I set up. It's beautiful out here, but it's not like I intend to settle down and grow old. I'm a building a much bigger version of the rover now. With some clever design choices I should be able to fit it with a generator, 3D printer and stasis chamber so it's all self-reliable and caring to all my needs. I intend to check what's beyond the horizon. Maybe there's a way out. Maybe there are other survivors out there. Day 26 There was an unexpected turn of events today. The armored gorillas paid me a visit. I don't think they like the mining machines that much so they came to tell me. I thought I could hide inside the base and wait it out, but the beasts started throwing huge rocks at the walls and the walls were caving in with a screeching noise all around me. I fired up the one mining machine I have in my base to serve as a distraction. Luckily enough I scheduled a test run of my new mobile base for this day. It was standing by all powered up and ready. I made a run for it, quickly got into the cockpit and got away this time. But there's no going back now. I'm a Nomad. Hundreds of stories like this await you in Planet Nomads. Come and survive your own. Game Features: completely mineable voxel terrain physics-ruled block-based building actual wheel physics for vehicles, rails, traps and gadgets three types of wheels hover physics multiple biomes based on temperature and humidity Improved animal AI to catch you off guard climate-based creature diversity automated mining machines and production blocks mobile bases survival mechanics embedded to the game's core design constant evolution based on community feedback\",\n",

Enrolling in one of the five wings of the CRONUS Corporation - each with its own features, mechanics and game options - and embark on a one way trip inside the Dome in the quest for unique artifacts as you avoid radiation, anomalies and a whole host of creatures out to do you harm. You may start as an ordinary company employee but you will eventually become the driving force behind the narrative that takes place before, during, and after the disaster known as ‘The Incident’.

Once you’re familiar with the basics, you are thrust into an open world filled with riches and danger.

Will they be allies or enemies? That choice – and the future of the Dome – is in your hands. Not everyone under the Dome is your friend; quite the reverse in fact. If you’re a smart likeable character (with a high charisma rating) you might be able to talk your way out of things. But more likely it’s time for a bit of ultra-violence. And that means weapons; lots of weapons. And there’s no shortage of choice: from high tech beam weapons through to a solid right hook, there’s loads of way to bring down a hostile group of foes.

       " \"Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same? SYNOPSIS Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit. SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial. Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out. Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map. HIDE OR FLIGHT In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them. The tools will allow you to Stun enemies Blind them See through walls Heal yourself and people around you. Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize and create your own trial patient. Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish. Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it? INVESTIGATE You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients. The Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down. Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity. Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning: The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images. This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.\",\n",

Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Kingdoms and Castles is the first Fig funded game to be released. Its crowd funding campaign succeeded with 725% of its goal and was supported by 1,400 backers. Supporters of the game could both pledge and invest during the Fig campaign.\",\n",

       " 'A pixel game that tells the story of bad elementary school students in the 1990s. The game is full of nostalgic elements of the 90s, while adding light puzzle solving and platform jumping elements. Players need to help this primary school student named Wang Han solve puzzles and obstacles, discover the truth behind the game events, and make Wang Han face up to the mistakes he has made and re-behave. In the 1990s, social transformation and population mobility intensified, and the interweaving of old and new contradictions caused various acute social problems to emerge one after another, and the crime rate gradually increased. In such an atmosphere of the times, people in a small southwestern machinery factory are distracted, adults do not want to work, and wander around all day long, but for a sixth-grade elementary school student named Wang Han in the factory, this is a free time. Classes, stealing, playing video games, growing savagely. The rebellious and unruly personality made Wang Han a stranger in the eyes of his peers, and a bad child in the eyes of teachers and adults, but all the surrounding rejection of him did not prompt Wang Han to change his mind, but pushed him on the opposite path. So Wang Han began to mess around with bad young people in the society. The growing hormones made his words and deeds more and more extreme. It was not until he witnessed a shooting that Wang Han realized that he had fallen into the abyss of evil. Game features:： The background of the game was set in the 1990s during the layoff wave. A kid from a machinery factory in a small town in Southwest China skipped class and wandered all day.

Whether you grow your fledgling settlement into a bustling inn or a central trade hub, or you instead content yourself with building a prosperous and self-sufficient homestead or livestock ranch, everything rests in your hands - including the very lives of your clanfolk.

Morning rituals, socializing, and rest punctuate a day of chores: sowing seeds, tilling soil, fishing, hunting, crafting, and cooking. Every member of the family has their own traits, aspirations, dreams, and skills that help determine what they do best. They will care for themselves and for each other, and they will seek to better themselves over time. Your youngest family members are full of potential and learn from working alongside their elders - teach them to hunt, cook, clean, build, or farm, ensuring all the core survival skills are carried forward to the next generation when the elders must be put to rest. The warm summers give way to crisp fall nights and brutal winters before life and spring return to the highlands - your survival depends on your ability to plan ahead and adapt to the flow of the seasons. Each season presents its own challenges and opportunities - whether picking berries, trapping eels, hunting rabbit, or seeking out mushroom patches, you'll need to make the most of the opportunities of medieval life. Soil conditions change and a host of factors impact how well your crops grow. Till the soil, employ techniques like slash-and-burn farming, and train the right farmers to keep your clan fed. The environment presents constant challenges - your livestock, your wares, and your clanfolk themselves must be kept safe from heavy rain and sub-zero temperatures. Water left in the cold turns to ice that must be melted over a fire. Food soaked in the rain spoils quickly, though wet objects don't catch fire as easily. Farm animals without shelter can die of poor health, and unless your people are properly clothed in furs, they can freeze when not standing next to the warmth of a fire. Establish your homestead starting with nothing but the land around you. Build the knowledge of survival across generations - every collected branch, tree, stone, and reed unlocks new ideas and methods your clanfolk can use to improve their living conditions. From sleeping in the dirt under the night sky to constructing properly ventilated houses and barns made of brick and stone, you'll be unlocking new materials to use and items to craft every step of the way. Technological advances happen naturally over time as you work the raw materials the land gives you, spurring your clanfolk to the creation of new ideas and methods. Pottery, bricks, and tiles are only available after you first dig up clay. Manufacture of iron tools are the product of chipping away at the right mountains. Working with furs is the result of hunting and skinning animals at the butcher's block. Maintain complex and realistic production chains across the seasons, prioritizing tasks and setting crafting quotas and requirements. Balance the need for essentials and luxuries alike. Prepare yourself for inevitable disasters – poor health, harsh weather, and raging fires can turn a thriving homestead into a graveyard or a funeral pyre. Your clan is not the only family in the highlands - traders, travelers, and neighbors seeking work will visit, giving you an opportunity to make new friends, earn coin, or grow your settlement. Trading posts attract members of other clans peddling useful goods and seeking to purchase your wares for themselves. Your reputation with another clan determines the types of goods their traders bring, and with each clan specializing in their own products, the right friends can ensure your survival. Travelers seek lodging as they pass by your homestead, and if you so choose you can provide them shelter. Particularly happy guests might extend their stay or pay good coin, and building a bustling inn can be an attractive possibility. Workers from other clans will arrive at job boards from time to time seeking an opportunity to earn money in exchange for their labor. A few extra skilled hands can go a long way towards finishing the harvest, bolstering your hunting parties, or staffing your newly built inn. Clanfolk is a game about life and family. Lead the generations of your clan to experience full lives in the Scottish Highlands.\",\n",

The story starts in a little-known protodynastic period in which you will be able to observe the birth of the Old Egypt and finished with the death of Cleopatra VII. The most important aspect is the skillful management of urban planning by shaping the grid of streets, placing buildings and their mutual relation. Well-designed city will greatly improve economic efficiency which may convert into city income. Diplomacy and politics: The governor will face very difficult choices to be made in a constantly changing political environment. Costly expeditions, Pharaoh and other cities requests, military threat and a mixture of different cultures will be a commonplace. A series of wrong choices can cost the loss of trading partners and low interest in the city by settlers. Moreover, the total lack of obedience to the rulers may end up with a civil war. Religion: Deity will be able to interfere with daily life but it will be done implicitly. The main aspect of religion will be satisfying the need for access to the places of worship, providing supplies for temples or organizing festivals. Neglecting this sphere may result in a dangerous social unrest on a par with e.g. famine . Trade: Trade is the most important element in royal treasury . Without it, it is very difficult for economic stability built solely on taxes. Therefore, in the interest of the player, producing goods for export at prices that will be able to change dynamically depending on the geopolitical situation, will be required.',\n",

In the years since Orcs Must Die! 2 , Maximillian and Gabriella have done their best to rebuild the once-mighty Order. Their new enemy, the Unchained, is no longer the mindless horde defeated twice before, but instead an organized army led by its own powerful heroes. Killin’ Orcs and Smashin’ Dorks Orcs Must Die!’s classic white-knuckle witch’s brew of action and strategy returns, letting players team up with their friends to lay waste to millions of new invading monsters! Build an impenetrable gauntlet of traps to hack, grind, flatten, gibletize and incinerate foes before they charge into the heart of the rift! It's Definitely a Trap The only thing better than building traps for murdering minions is building more traps! Play to unlock traps, then upgrade them to be even deadlier. Players cover fortresses in gleeful torture devices and engineer a variety of hilarious and violent ends for invading minions. Customize a strategy for every battle. The hordes are no match for the powers of elements and physics! Real Action Heroes Are you mage enough to defend the rifts?

Players assemble a team to defend their rift, but at the same time another team is playing on the same map in some… spooky… alternate dimension or something. These other players can distract your team with spells, minions, and huge bosses to make you lose rift points. But of course, players can pay 'em back by doing the same! The team with the most rift points at the end of the match wins.\",\n",
       " 'Be part of the Hibernian Workshop community by joining our dedicated Discord server ! Explore the secrets of a mysterious fallen temple and put your Templar faith to the test in Dark Devotion, where no sacrifice is too great in praise of your God. Measure your devotion and your bravery by journeying into deepest darkness for answers to questions that will challenge your very existence. Dark Devotion features a richly detailed, immersive narrative that unfolds a sombre tale of your Templar religion’s irresistible calling. Every encounter challenges your fortitude, piety, and conviction as you move deeper into your cursed pilgrimage. Spanning four unique worlds, each with their own incredibly detailed environments, you’ll wield dozens of weapons in your quest to discover the Temple’s secret: all the while assailed by dark enemies and devious bosses whose core mission is to destroy your soul and damn you forever. Throughout Dark Devotion you’ll discover an array of weapons, armors, and relics with which to enhance your character. Each item has its own attributes and statistics, and is customizable with mystical runes. It is essential that you maximize your strengths and adapt your inventory to the enemy you’re facing. Choose wisely... Dark Devotion is a story of perseverance, dedication, and secrets. Every chest you open, every item you encounter holds another piece of the story: be it a letter, weapon, or clue, all will help you on your quest. Whether you find these secrets amongst the shadows or in the dead hand of another character ...well, that all depends. In the Temple, Faith is your only recourse against the heathen droves. Defeat them to collect Faith and unlock secret paths, special chests, and more. But remember to use your Faith sparingly. Nothing lasts forever. The Temple yearns to see you dead. Your survival depends on using the right item at the right time to heal your wounds or dispel a curse. Some of these items can be looted, others are scattered throughout the Temple in secret places. Employ them wisely… your life depends on it. The eye of your God is ever-watchful. Complete an act of bravery or skill, and your God might bless you. But the Temple is also rife with despair and sickness, ready to destroy those who lack courage and temperance. Learn quickly its ways, or suffer. Salvation is fleeting, so choose your route wisely. Every world in Dark Devotion offers several different paths. Each one is original, but all are interconnected, and the only commonality they share is that there is no turning back. Completing your quest requires shrewd interpretation of the secrets shrouded within the Temple. It’s easy to get lost, though this might bring you favor...depending on the secret you uncover. Perhaps the Temple will reveal a hidden altar where one’s story can be saved if one honors the Temple appropriately...or perhaps not. ● Dynamic and heavy combat ● Dozens of weapons, armor, and items for various fighting styles ● Intricate system of blessings, curses, and illnesses ● White-knuckle boss battles ● Rich, complex storyline ● Dark levels and brooding environments',\n",

Good luck. Acquitted is a satirical fast-paced zombie shooter / hack-and-slash with elements of base building and turret defense that takes place on randomly generated and fully destructible maps. Fight for your life against decades of bad parenting &amp; education that has physically manifested into a skateboard-swinging, feces-flinging horde of undead rage! Choose from up to 18 different weapons and items to defend yourself against the hundreds of braindead hellbent on either putting you in a grave or a prison cell for refusing. The controls are simple (WASD + mouse twin-stick shooter) and the game takes less than a minute to learn, but the difficulty and strategic complexity increase over time. But what kind of strategies are festering inside the brains of the braindead? Small zombies will swarm you with a variety of hand weapons while others stand back and throw bricks and bottles. They will work together from different directions to surround you, use their sheer numbers and mass to trap you, flank your position, determine complex paths and even smash barricades to reach you. Besides inflicting damage with melee weapons and projectiles, they can also blind you with foul substances, control your movement by covering the map with molotov flames, steal your weapons and send you flying back with jump kicks. Gameplay gets very interesting and chaotic when several of these enemy strategies are combined at once. Big zombies are few in number but incredibly powerful and dangerous. Some can grab you and eat you in a single bite, while others can bulldoze their way through walls to ruin your cover and open the floodgates to more threats. Often they act as large meat shields for smaller zombies advancing behind them. Thankfully they are too big to fit through small openings, which gives you lots of escape options (especially by placing barricades) - but don't expect them to stand near doorways letting you shoot them. They will try to find a bigger opening or, failing that, hide behind cover or circle your hiding spot menacingly as the smaller zombies ooze inside the building to flush you out. Big zombies also leave their bodies behind as obstacles, either blocking your path or maybe providing valuable cover.

       " \"World Setting There once was a great war between the gods and the demons. Known as the Ragnarok War, this war drove humanity to the brink of extinction. Under the protection of the goddesses, the surviving humans were sheltered and continue to live on the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil. Many years later, the protagonist Loki and 4 other royal heirs prepare to invade Yggdrasil, contending for the throne of the Dark Lord. Story ...Gods in heaven, demons on earth, and a giant floating continent inhabited by humans. The continent known as the 'Floating Continent of Yggdrasil' is also considered a floating miniature garden of the gods. It is a place where the human survivors of the great war live, the continent closest to the realm of the gods. The Dark Lord Surt who has his eyes set on that continent said this to his heirs: 'The one who brings me the Heart of Yggdrasil said to be safeguarded by the goddesses on the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil shall be the heir to my throne. As long as you get your hands on the Heart of Yggdrasil, I will not question your methods or your past transgressions. You are free to make alliances between yourselves, sabotage, or even 'remove' your fellow heirs as you would any obstacle. Kill and rampage as you wish, and prove to me your strength and worth!' Hearing those words, Surt's heirs, all having motivations of their own, began their invasion of the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil. Among them, an ostracized member of the demon nobility, Loki, has also decided to participate in the prolonged battle for the throne. To become the Dark Lord means you will stand above and at the very top of every demon. If corrupting the goddesses said to be as beautiful and elegant as a flower in full bloom will be the key that leads to him gaining the throne, he saw no reason not to participate. 5 invading demons, and 5 goddesses fighting back. All the pieces have fallen into place. All that remains is for him to wager his own existence in this battle and fight. In a continent caught in a whirlpool of chaos and ambition, Loki's own ambition burns brightly.

       " 'Belladonna is a gothic adventure game, twisted and dark. Take the role of a corpse girl rising from the dead in an abandoned laboratory, and unravel the mysteries concerning your own death and reanimation. After the death of their young child, doctor Wolfram von Trauerschloss and his wife Belladonna are left to deal with the tragedy however they are able. The doctor launches into a dark obsession, devoting his life to the quest of conquering death. The madness spreads and Belladonna is soon dragged into the despair, but the tale takes surprising turns as the dead are brought back to life and the living are not to be trusted. The game explores various themes, such as the role of villains and heroes, moral value systems and different kinds of horror. It’s a point-and-click adventure, and it will ask you to read longer texts which are inspired in style by Mary Shelley’s novel, Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. This game is not scary in the way in which a Hollywood horror flick is scary, but it is certainly no child’s play. The story goes into an eerie place beyond life and death, and puts you into the mind of the unliving creatures and their worldviews.',\n",

       " 'S.B.T.F. is a very hard arcade-style / rogue-like / perma-death first person shooter. You play as Marines who must brave dark, claustrophobic and terrifyingly intense Space Beast infested spacecraft in order to extract critical data and lucrative upgrades. Can you make it out alive? The game revolves around the concept of a procedurally generated maze-like spacecraft which is unique each time, within which the Marines must search out DataCores to be downloaded. The spacecraft are infested with Beasts that are extremely lethal, and the Marines must brave these dark and hostile environments in order to complete the objective of retrieving all critical data and ultimately setting the Reactor core to overload. Aside from either all purpose automatic Rifles or powerful Shotguns, the Marines initially only have a rudimentary Tracker device that detects nearby motion as well as the distance to the nearest DataCore. The DataCores can however contain lucrative Upgrades that will empower the Marines with better ammunition, a better motion tracker, and other useful functionality that will significantly increase the chances of survival. Key to managing the unknown spaces within each spacecraft is the intelligent use of Doors, sealing of sections behind the team in order to keep from being overwhelmed from several directions at once. Closing Doors controls the space, but they also make it harder to flee if the need should arise. Additionally, automated Sentry robots are scattered throughout the spacecraft, and these can be activated in order to further aid in stemming the never ending tide of Space Beasts. Sentries offer a significant amount of additional firepower, and can often be the difference between life and death when the Marines are being overwhelmed. While Sentries are programmed to avoid firing when Marines stray are in their field of fire, friendly fire incidents can still happen. Once all DataCores have been retrieved, the final objective is to disable all Reactor Coolants in order to destroy the spacecraft. Once this is done the Marines only have 90 seconds to find their way back to the Airlock for extraction before the Reactor overloads, obliterating the spacecraft and everything aboard. Space Beast Terror Fright employs both procedural level generation as well as a procedurally arranged music scoring. Audio and visuals are all tightly synced to the action in order to deliver a super-intense combat experience that feels like an awesome action movie. Both local and networked co-op play are supported, with 1-4 players via keyboard / mouse and XBox 360 game controllers. Both local and networked play allow viewing all of the action via split-screen.

       " 'Synopsis: In ancient times long ago, in order to find his beloved missing daughter, the divine Jade Emperor opened the gates of heaven, allowing a direct connection between heaven and earth. This was done, so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine Li Tribe became a cult that worshipped demons and practiced in the occult, divorcing themselves from the businesses of the mortal realm. Forces of evil suddenly arose, inciting wars across the continent, condemning people into a life of fears and sufferings. Emperor Zhuanxu feared the demon Chiyou would once again ravage the mortal realm. Limited by his own capabilities, he sought the help of the Queen of Huaxu, who once assisted Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor in warding off the Otherworld with the Bell of Donghuang. Both Fuxi and Nuwa—the children of the Queen of Huaxu—also supported Emperor Zhuanxu in convincing the Queen, for they too could not bear to watch people suffer any longer. In the end, the gates to heaven were finally sealed with the powers of the Divine Artifacts combined. Since then, no mortals were able to ascend, nor were gods able to descend at will. This incident was later recorded down in history as “Juedi Tiantong.” Features: This latest entry broke new grounds in comparison with previous titles in the series, including: the new lighting system that better establishes moods, creating various atmospheric scenes; as well as facial animation and lip-sync systems, MVN motion capture system to elevate the quality standard of all characters in every aspect. These new technologies not only improve visuals but also game immersion, enabling the players to fully comprehend the behaviors and feelings of the protagonists. The battle system has been replaced with a real-time, encounter-based gameplay mechanism, making the battles more intense than ever. Improved returning features exclusive to the Xuan-Yuan Sword series include: the Urn of Spirit Infusion that enables demon-synthesis and equipment refinement; the Guardian System that allows your captured demons to fight on your side; and the Miracle System that grants additional attack buffs. A new “Battle Formation” system is also introduced in this latest entry, allowing for a richer and better gaming experience for the players.',\n",

Escape the clutches of an Evil Wizard and discover the secrets hidden within the spellbound castle of your ancestors. We take the role of princess Tsioque, imprisoned in a castle overtaken by the Evil Wizard. When darkness falls on your ancestral home, places formerly familiar suddenly turn unfriendly and dangerous. The castle walls have become a deadly trap - we must escape and thwart the Evil Wizard's plans before the spell he has cast on the castle escalates, triggering events beyond anyone's control... A 100% hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animated 2d adventure game with a unique atmosphere. Humor? Check. Darkness? Check. Suspense? Check! What more could you ask for? Story with a twist - a clever story that may surprise you. Beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds. Beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds. Fully voiced dialogue tracks. Exceptional soundtrack by Edward Harrison (NEOTOKYO, LUCKY DAY FOREVER) and Elle Kharitou, dynamically illustrating the gameplay and adjusted to your every action. The protagonist - a little girl with a talent for bringing chaos and destruction wherever she goes. Those who dare stand in her way are in for a lot of trouble... A changing, mysterious and dangerous world - even before the Wizard's attack, the castle held many secrets. Now, bound by a powerful spell, the castle not only became home to demons and magical creatures, but has also been affected itself by the evil power... It bends and shapeshifts, forming layers upon layers of transformation and illusion... It is an essential part of the plot, and - especially later in the game - an element tightly integrated into the gameplay. You can 'die' in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware. There won't always have the comfort of infinite time to solve a problem, sometimes you may have to think fast! Other times you may want to think twice before choosing a new course of action, as a wrong decision may cost you your freedom... or worse! The world of TSIOQUE is inhabited by creatures of all sorts - humans, animals, monsters, you name it. Don't let appearances deceive you, some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a seemingly terrifying monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even when events turn for the worst, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, which she will find in least expected places. The main inspiration is inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best scritps. But of course we're not living in cultural vaccuum. While creating TSIOQUE, we couldn't help but be inspired by things that thrilled, shocked and amazed us in the past, that burned forever into our memory in the childhood days spent in front of the pale light of CRT monitors. Among many other inspirations, we could certainly count: a smart, humorous story backed by beautiful art style of DAY OF THE TENTACLE, simplicity of the gameplay and a serious approach to a younger player in games by Ron Gilbert like PAJAMA SAM, a vivid, dangerous world seen through the eyes of a boy in HEART OF DARKNESS, wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for failures in DRAGON'S LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly.\",\n",

       " \"The latest title in the famous Combat Mission franchise of wargames, now on Steam. Shock Force 2 brings you to a hypothetical conflict in Syria between the forces of NATO and the Syrian Army. Take command of US Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) to fight against Syrian Army Infantry, Mechanized and Armored units in an arid setting. Experience the full range of modern threats to conventional military forces, including irregular combat forces, terrorists, spies, suicide bombers, IED's and other deadly tools employed in the asymmetric warfare of the modern day. Play the Task Force Thunder campaign, more than a dozen carefully crafted battles, or unlimited Quick Battles. HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED Players are assigned detailed missions to accomplish based on a richly diverse set of Objectives. Missions can be played in either Real Time or our WeGo hybrid turn based mode introduced with the first Combat Mission game 20 years ago. WeGo allows each player to plan out 60 seconds of combat and then watch as both sides' commands are carried out simultaneously. The WeGo system also allows for re-watching turn action and playing against another player by email (PBEM) or 'hotseat' on a single computer. RealTime and WeGo head to head play can also use TCP/IP on a LAN or over the Internet. Massive replayability comes from a unique Quick Battle system which allows players to purchase their own custom force and fight over the battlefield of their choice from a wide array of different maps. A powerful map and scenario Editor allows you to create battles or campaigns for yourself and others. HOW UNITS ARE PORTRAYED All units are portrayed one for one in 1:1 scale in high resolution polygon 3D models with articulated suspensions, animated hatches, and other features that make them feel real. Unlike other 3D tactical wargames, Combat Mission combines real world physics with a thoroughly researched portrayal of forces, right down to what the individual soldiers cary into battle. Advanced vehicle damage modeling allows for tracking of each sub-system, including the most realistic ballistics, armor and post-armor effects available in any game. Unlike other games that claim this level of realism, Combat Mission actually delivers it across the whole spectrum of warfare, including the interaction of weather, lighting, and terrain on how units and their weapons function. \\u2003Perhaps the most important feature of Combat Mission is its detailed and innovative portrayal of 'soft factors'. Experience, Morale, Leadership, and other elements operate at the individual soldier level and collectively transform how units behave. As important as these battlefield concerns are, most other games give them short shrift or don't bother covering them at all. In the real world having the best weapons means nothing if the soldiers crewing them are balled up in fear or are too distracted to see what's going on around them. HOW THINGS WORK BEHIND THE SCENES Weapon penetration values and armor protection are based on extremely detailed real life data and scientific algorithms that are specific to exactly what is seen in the game. There are no arbitrary values (hitpoints) or precalculated resolution tables (CRTs) that so often produce frustratingly inaccurate results. The advanced Tactical AI (TacAI) models the psychological state and inherent qualities of every soldier on the battlefield, allowing for genuine battlefield behavior from every soldier as if they were their own free thinking individual. \\u2003The simulation of independent soldiers is important in another regard because it allows Combat Mission to have what we call Relative Spotting. This is a system which ensures that each soldier has their own unique view of the battlefield, avoiding the 'Borg' issue seen in many games where once one person has spotted an enemy, automatically everyone else has spotted it and can fire on it as well. Any wargamer worth his weight in gunpowder knows that Fog of War is one of the most important battlefield elements. An unprecedented simulation of Command and Control (C2) combines with Relative Spotting to realistically portray the flow of information and responsibility between soldiers as they share information with each other on what they can see on the battlefield \\u2003All of these elements, and many more, seamlessly fit together to create the most realistic battlefield experience out there. The realism level isn't pushed in your face with lots of data and obscure references. Instead players experience all of this with the 3D graphical environment. Combat Mission's visceral game environment is what attracts players, the richness of the gameplay is what keeps them playing for years on end. Features: - Tactical warfare at battalion and below scale in a true 3D environment - Command individual vehicles, teams, and squads - Expansive simulation of 'soft factors' such as Morale, Experience, and Leadership - Innovative systems portraying Fog of War, Spotting, Line of Sight, Command &amp; Control, and Objectives - Unmatched realistic physics, ballistics, and battlefield effects - Fight in a wide range of weather and lighting conditions, all of which realistically impact fighting abilities - Unique hybrid system for RealTime or WeGo (turn based) play - Full featured Editor for maps, scenarios, and campaigns - Quick Battle system sets up deliberate or randomized battles based on player specifications - Single player and head to head play, including Play By Email (PBEM) - Detailed and realistic combat formation for the United States Army and Syrian Army - Two types of Syrian Unconventional Forces, Spies, IEDs, and VIEDs - One large campaign, a small training campaign, 20 standalone scenarios, and numerous Quick Battle maps. - On map mortars, mortar vehicles, drones, anti-aircraft fire, and other modern warfare features - Expanded arid combat environment, now including waterways, bridges, and other new terrain - Intricately detailed and highly realistic combat equipment for the United States Army and Syrian Army, including 41 vehicles and 35 assorted small arms and crew weapons. - Expansive maps with 1m x 1m resolution allow for short and long range action across complex terrain - Buildings have explicitly simulated doors, windows, and floors - Weather and ground condition modelling systems allow for everything from dry sunny days to muddy stormy nights, with visibility and mobility dynamically affected by the conditions. Some Combat Mission games include the full range of Winter, Spring, and Fall weather as well - Line of Sight and Line of Fire are separately calculated, which means sometimes you can see something you can't shoot and sometimes you can shoot at things you can't see - Soldier posture (prone, kneeling, standing) affects everything including spotting, cover, and ability to engage enemies - Line of Sight is calculated from the 'eyeballs' or 'sensor' point, not a generic value - Much of Combat Mission's realism comes from correctly simulating important low level details, such as crew responsibilities, vehicle vision blocks, high tech sensors, etc. A 3 man tank with a few cloudy vision blocks doesn't have to be artificially made inferior to a 5 man tank with a commander's cupola and separate vision blocks for the gunner and loader because in Combat Mission it happens naturally - The way a nation organizes its units has a huge impact on how they perform in combat, therefore great pains are taken to accurately portray formations as they are in real life for a particular point in time - Lighting affects combat in no small way in real life as well as in the game. The correct lighting conditions are simulated based on time of day, time of year, and weather\",\n",

Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors.

       " \"Manage your own farm in the game Farm Manager 2018! Expand your farm business, produce cheap and sell your products at high prices. Control the land cultivation process, select the best employees, buy the most appropriate farm equipment, raise livestock and process the harvested crops. Various camera modes allow you to enter into a strategic view as well as to look at the world through the eyes of the employee. Respond to the changing weather and seasons. Create a greenhouse to sell crops in early spring. Buy new and used special agricultural machinery to quickly harvest and sell crops before their expiration date. Optimize costs and employ seasonal workers only during the harvest time. Accept challenges from neighbors to prove who is the best farmer in the area. You do not want to cultivate typical wheat, don't you? Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Manager 2018 you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Manager 2018 allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background. Farm Manager 2018 offers 3 different game modes! You have a campaign, 15 scenarios and a free mode. The campaign will guide you through all major aspects of the game and learn how to properly manage the farm. Scenarios show how to deal with specific situations and tasks. In the free mode you will have complete freedom of actions that will enrich your tasks and contracts. Choose your favorite game mode, and let's do it! If you miss any crop, machinery or building you can always make it by yourself, by simply adding to the game and share with other players. Shared standard components allow for faster creation of the target model. The expected object parameters can be set by selecting it in a clear form.\",\n",

In addition, highly realistic controls and many functions and details just as they exist in reality round off the simulation experience perfectly. Driving a tram is not complicated! You can start with the beginner mode and activate controls for advanced &amp; professional users. Steer with great precision through the traffic and get your passengers to their destination. All of this with incredible graphics and great fun! Discover the heart of Vienna - one of the most beautiful and greenest cities in the world! The historic city center with the magnificent Ringstrasse, countless sights, classical buildings and a wonderful ambience. At any time, from anywhere in the world. On an area of almost 4,000,000 m² the map with the tram network in TramSim extends around the famous Ringstrasse, the heart of Vienna to the green Prater as well as to the south of Vienna. Many sights are waiting to be discovered by you! We have implemented the brand-new tram generation „Flexity“ of the Vienna transport company Wiener Linien down to the last detail, with outstanding sound and driving dynamics - exactly like the real thing. On a route network of almost 25 km in length in a densely built-up area of Vienna's inner city, you can put your driving skills to the test. Whether open-world, scheduled service with timetable, level ranking or our tram-challenges - there is something for everyone! Take your passengers safely to their destination and prove your driving skills at the tram-challenges. Many hours of fun, entertainment and wonderful impressions await you! You will never cease to be amazed by the quality of our buildings. With great attention to detail, several hundreds of buildings have been reconstructed true to the original and equipped with many small extras. For all enthusiasts we have not spared to implement all operational objects correctly and in detail. Exact track geometry, original switch point models of various designs and many other details at all corners and ends along the track can be discovered. Shortly before the end of 2017, the prototype of the new tram for Vienna was completed and handed over to Wiener Linien in 2018. The new low-floor trams will successively replace the last high-floor models of the Wiener Linien. The Flexity convinces with its low energy consumption, for example through LED lighting or air conditioning, which is energy-savingly adjusted to the number of passengers in the tram. The interior of the new tram is flexibly designed. Generous multi-purpose areas, some of which are equipped with folding seats, provide more space for baby carriages and wheelchairs, which also makes it easier to get on and off the tram quickly. This shortens the time spent at the tram stop and allows the vehicles to be on time. Experience the vehicle novelty and test your skills! The E2 was put into service for the first time in August 1978 and has been a prominent feature of the Viennese cityscape ever since. The E2 is based on the Mannheim type and differs from the E1 in several technical innovations, such as swing-out steps and a newly designed interior and is used almost exclusively in conjunction with the c5 sidecar. Production of the E2 vehicles was discontinued in 1990, but the vehicles are still in use in large numbers in tram operations in Vienna. The articulated railcar is equipped with 'chopper control'. The 'chopper control', also called pulse control, is a circuit for controlling motors. Here, the motor current is controlled by transistor pulse controllers. This transistor equipment primarily ensures that the car starts up and brakes quickly. Discover the central route network of the Vienna city center. With its track around the Ringstrasse, the Vienna Tram forms the heart of public transport in Vienna. Although primarily a daily means of transport, the well-developed tram network of the Wiener Linien connects the most diverse districts of Vienna with each other and is therefore ideal for discovering the city and its sights. You can look forward to many more features in the coming years, more content from us and external developers and modders, and the opportunity to get creative yourself. This is just the start of the most modern simulation for urban transportation.\",\n",

       " \"Damned: A Randomized Online Horror Game - What is Damned? Damned is a randomized online horror game for up to 5 players (4 survivors and 1 monster). You’ll be able to play as one of four people trapped in different haunted places (hotels, hospitals, etc). As a survivor your main objective will be finding your way out, as well as helping your friends get out too. You’ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape. And sometimes you’ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who’s there only to find and kill you and your friends. You’ll also be able to play as the monster. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its gameplay and hunting style. - What kind of horror game is Damned? Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way. When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide. This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement. This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game session, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!) - Why is Damned a randomized game? Every stage in Damned is randomized: Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear; The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be; The way to win a match as a survivor is also randomized; Even the stage may trigger random events to scare the survivors inside. - Why is Damned a competitive and cooperative game? Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor. - How to play as a survivor? As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session): You and your friends will be searching the level for keys and items to help in your escape; Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are; The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes; Challenge yourself to find the exit and get out alive. - How to play as the monster? As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its play style. It's up to you to play a few rounds with each monster and decide which one works best for you. How are you going to hunt and kill the survivors? - Why is Damned worth buying? Because it’s fun! It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you. It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide! And also because it’s really fun to play as the monster as well. You’ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you. We really put you in the skin of a terrifying monster. - Links and contact: Got any questions and/or suggestions?

This is a story about the revenge of a girl who lost her arms and legs to a devil… Noel The Mortal Fate is a charismatic adventure game developed by Kanawo with RPG Maker. After its success in Japan, as well as gaining a manga adaption, Noel The Mortal Fate is now available worldwide on Steam in English, Japanese and Simplified Chinese with seasons 1 - 7 available now in one package. Noel Cerquetti, a girl who lost her arms and legs in a contract, works together with the great devil Caron, to get her revenge against one man. This man – dubbed the 'pride of the citizens' – is Burrows, the mayor of LaPlace. Why is this girl furiously seeking revenge against this unrivalled man, loved by the people for bringing peace to LaPlace that was once overrun by the mafia? While unsteady without her limbs, Noel doesn't give up on her path of revenge, as Caron watches mercilessly, at times risking his own life to support her. With vengeance, the pair begins their chase after Burrows. Performing at the memorial ceremony... The highest honor, goal, and dream for every young musician living in LaPlace. While everyone waits for the announcements nervously, only Noel looks confident. She was certain. 'I will win the piano competition this year.' However, that confidence would soon turn to despair. The winner was her best friend, Jillian. Burrows, the mayor of LaPlace, proposes a 'deal' to a desperate Noel. Believing his words, Noel heads to the meeting, without knowing a devil was waiting... After losing both her arms and legs, Noel vows revenge against Mayor Burrows. To find evidence of corruption, she attempts to sneak into the shipping company, Aquarius. But the Mayor's secretary, Cybilla, anticipates this, setting a trap for Noel and her devilish partner, Caron. Caught in an underground labyrinth, the two encounter numerous challenges. Can they overcome the dangers and safely escape? But amidst their escape, Noel seems to be acting strange... Barely escaping, Noel and Caron swim to a hideout – a place Caron knows well. In this 'hideout,' there are many traces of Caron and a certain someone living here. After being confronted by Noel with evidence, Caron begins to speak of his past with “that person' he once made a contract with. And the shocking truth was revealed... Now marked as terrorists, a police officer, claiming to be 'the Demon of Justice', appears before Noel and Caron. To avenge a personal grudge, a young man called Oscar D, begins to attack Noel and Caron with a mysterious ability. In addition to the movements of the police, Jillian takes action to save Noel. The girl and devil's revenge move to a whole new level with the entanglement of various characters’ intentions. After a desperate battle with Oscar D, Caron is taken away from Noel. Left alone in a hopeless situation, Noel finds hope in one man... The Bomber who once confronted Noel and Caron – the Demon of Explosions – 'Fugo Dressel.' Noel breaks into the facility imprisoning Bomber by herself. But will Noel be able to take back Caron? With the help of the former enemy, Bomber, Noel rescues Caron. This was also the moment when Caron and Noel finally gain a fellow 'member.' And now, Noel's next goal is to take down Burrow's funding source, the Casino 'Misty.' Disguised in uniforms, Noel and the others sneak in. Take down the Casino swirling in conspiracy by using 'cheats!' Burrows loses his important source of funds as Casino 'Misty' goes up in flames. With a weakening police force, Noel and the others decide this is the time for the biggest attack. The day chosen for the final battle, is the one that changed Noel's fate… …the memorial ceremony.

Before every round, the players get to build one or more obstacles on the map. In the next round, all players have to pass all the obstacles, which have been built yet. Features Online/Local Multiplayer Singleplayer Campaign-like Singleplayer Map Editor 300 Different obstacles 25 Standard maps ( + Endless user created maps) Competitive, fun and exciting Controller support for ingame racing Minimalistic, but still nice graphics Online/Local Multiplayer So basically, the game is designed to be a fun multiplayer game. You race against your friends or other players, to finish as fast as possible and score as much points as possible. But instead of giving the winning player an advantage for the following rounds, like it is done in many other games, all players have the same conditions every round, as all players are racing on the same map, with the same obstacles. Besides of the racing, all players extend the map continuously, as every player can build obstacles, boosters or potential deadly objects on the end of each round. This way, the map gets more difficult or easier, but surely more interesting. It's totally up to you! To win in the end, you must collect the most points by scoring as good as possible in every round, outsmarting your opponents with your obstacles and your racing skill. Also, the game comes with a dedicated server, which allows you to set up your own local or online Cube Racer Server. It's a perfect opportunity to play some rounds with your friends, or to have some fun time on a hypothetically LAN-party ;) Singleplayer In Singleplayer, you can challenge yourself to race on different maps with various predefined obstacles to slam the fastest times you are capable of. Obstacles By playing games either in singleplayer or multiplayer mode, you earn credits for your performance. With these credits, you can unlock new types of obstacles time by time. You can also then use the credits to upgrade the obstacles you own, to make them maybe bigger, maybe stronger and develop your personal cube-racing strategy. At the beginning of a game, every player decides, which obstacles to take along into the game, which makes every online-game individual and exciting. Map Editor The game also includes a map editor where you can live your creativity and make your own maps for Cube Racer. You then have the possibility, to either just play your custom maps on your own server, or to upload them to the Steam-Workshop and share your creations with the whole community. Accordingly, you can also browse through other players map creations to download and play your favorite ones.\",\n",

       " \"Design tanks in a dedicated and intuitive designer, allowing the realistic armour mechanics that make tank combat so unique. Explore tank design's challenges through WW1, the interwar period and the early, mid and late stages of WW2. Please note: There is currently no dedicated tutorial. If you don't enjoy figuring things out or you don't know much about tanks, it may be worth holding off until better guidance is in place. Hull &amp; Turret Shape Design Easy to use and flexible enough to give you endless design starting points. Drag on a face or edge to move it. Bigger compartments create more internal space but have more surface to armour. Well angled shapes may bounce incoming shells off entirely, leaving only a scratch and several ringing ears. Armour Design Set the thickness of each armour plate, allowing you to block shots from your foes. Though the weight and space used adds up! Cannon Design Build a gun capable of piercing enemy armour. You'll need enough space and force to rotate it. Make sure you save enough room for ammo! Crew Design Humans are light but large and quite essential, squeeze them in and assign them one or more roles. Cramped and overworked crew perform poorly. Attached Parts Add functional and decorative parts to the exterior of your vehicle. These can define where internals are e.g. the engine is positioned where you place your exhausts and vents, then gets hit if a shell pierces your armour in that area. Place a fuel port in front of the driver and the fuel tank just might absorb a projectile, saving their life - if it doesn't ignite... Track Design Focus your tracks and suspension on trench crossing, mountain climbing, going fast or just looking cool. Engine Design Design anything from ship engines to lawnmower engines in a basic powerplant designer. Fuel Tank Design Set your fuel capacity and tank locations. Even bring them outside of the vehicle - if you don't mind them being shot off every now and then. Transmission Design Design your ratios - make it faster backwards than forwards or give it a 1st gear that can climb any mountain. One of these on each track will let one side drive while the other reverses, turning on the spot. Internal Component Health No hit-points. Vehicles carry on the fight as long as their critical internals are still functioning. Full Powertrain Simulation Engines, transmissions &amp; tracks work together to move your tank with a realistic simulation, making vehicles feel like the real thing. Scenarios Battle in a range of environments with a team of your custom tanks, although make your design too expensive and you might be on your own. If your vehicle is destroyed, you carry on the fight in control of an ally - sometimes watching your previous self go up in flames.\",\n",

       " \"In Stonehearth, you pioneer a living world full of warmth, heroism, and mystery. Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You’ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It’s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends. Build and Grow Your City The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish. Level Up Your Settlers All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area. Player Driven Legacy Through Modding We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. As a modder you’ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where “the game” is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster.\",\n",
       " \"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style 'archaeological ruin exploration action game'. In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title’s hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the 'other' La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana. Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as 'Guardians' as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins. You won’t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey... La-Mulana was known as a 'Metroidvania'-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins. A classic experience : As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own. Explore at your own pace : By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. A colossal adventure : We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability. New horrors, new weapons : Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey. Widescreen support : The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors. The question we’ve asked ourselves throughout development is: 'How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?' Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruins Gather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruins Dive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progress A detailed and beautifully dot-rendered world Seven main weapons and over ten sub-weapons Over 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruins Over 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer’s tablet, the 'Mobile Super X3' Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the game Lumisa Kosugi (21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist) Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child. Either way, she is a Kosugi; that much is clear. She travels to La-Mulana to make her archaeological debut after accepting Xelpud's request to search the ruins. Lemeza Kosugi (36 years old; the previous game's protagonist) Tales of his exploits in the ruins of La-Mulana may be known worldwide, but he was also responsible for the ruins' destruction, and has gone into hiding as a result. His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret. Shawn Kosugi (67 years old) After revealing the 'Treasure of All Life' he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more. Although he technically retired after finishing his research on the 'Cradle of All Civilization', he finds himself slowly drawn back into the world of archaeology. Elder Xelpud (Age unknown) Upon the collapse of the La-Mulana ruins, his life as a 7th Child came to an end. He's been spending his time running the 'La-Mulana Ruins Tourist Spot' in hopes of finding purpose in life once again. As a result, he's become quite wealthy, and now lives a life of luxury full of beautiful women and fast cars. Mulbruk (3024 years old; looks/hopes to look about 24) Since her release from the ruins, Mulbruk has been happily living aboveground, pretending to be a 'normal' young woman. Using her amazing knowledge of history, she has become a treasure hunter. She's also become quite fashionable.\",\n",

We use the opera's premise as inspiration for the backstory, then re-imagined it for a modern setting. Michael Krikorian's score composes over 40 minutes of original music. He incorporates themes from Fidelio's overture and transforms them to fit the mood and atmosphere of the game. The score expands the emotional depth of the narrative while complementing the atmosphere of the island. \\u200b Stanley is played by Glenn Keogh, known for his roles in Transformers Age of Extinction, Once Upon A Time, and Sons of Anarchy. Glenn was born in Ireland. After reading the script, he signed on with the goal of bringing authenticity to Stanley's character.

Lead a ragtag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal power to see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies and a single shot can cost a cop their life. You’re not exactly the police, but you're the only ones on the side of justice Viktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community's leaders and local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. An outlaw band of renegade cops refuses to bow, however. With little hope of success, they fight on — for justice, and the soul of their town. Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key You're fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death. Explore, scavenge, and watch your back Rebel Cops features not only compact operations where you need to fight for every inch of ground, but also large, open locations to explore — the sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas — and, above all, grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan-out, and try to explore every corner. Take the high road, or the low road Zuev's mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money.

Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported! - OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account. - Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!) Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase! Overview OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type. Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease! OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip) Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too) Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification. Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made. Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode 'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game! (This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack) Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected. Important stuff you should know about We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works! Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games! We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020) If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll whip up a hotfix ASAP!\",\n",

Add 10,000 gold pieces for each input! Enjoy! At its core this is a combat game. The basic goal is simple, amass more points than your competition. Of course the different game modes will require different strategies but in the end, it is all about having fun. There is also a PvE component to the game for those who prefer a single player experience. On the maps, there will be various foods players can eat. These foods act as a sort of power up. When consumed by the player the “output” will be a unique explosive or other effect based on the food you eat. For example, if you eat a burrito the resulting bomb you “drop” will be a very powerful AOE explosion. Expect rather bizarre bomb explosion effects that will make the game fun and absolutely hilarious. There will be “bathrooms” that players can create that will allow you to invite your friends to partake in the mayhem. You can also join other people's bathrooms and fight hundred battles with others. A Built-in voice system will allow players to communicate with each other while playing.

       " \"An experiment has gone horribly awry, giving birth to a mischievous, shape-shifting blob of goo! A state-of-the-art tracking robot was created as a countermeasure to protect the house. Take the role of either character and join the frantic cat-and-mouse chase as the blob sneaks through the house while the robot hunts it down! Key Features: Intense chases Narrow escapes Online peer-to-peer multiplayer through Steam Unique character abilities Free! No micro-transactions, no in-app purchases, just free. Character Descriptions: Hider : A blob of sentient goo, the Hider's objective is to sneak around and gather as much goo as possible from canisters scattered throughout the house. It can turn into almost any object to disguise itself, but it also has a few defensive measures in case it is found by the Seeker. A brief sprint helps create some distance so the Hider can morph into a new object and vanish again. It can even vaporize a small percentage of its body to create a smoke screen that leaves a gelatinous residue on the Seeker's ocular unit. Once enough goo has been collected, the Hider can take over the Seeker by assimilating it into the glorious mass the Hider has become. If the Hider does not collect enough goo, however, it will run out of energy and the Seeker will reclaim the house in the name of order and cleanliness. Seeker : A robot hastily constructed to combat the goo, the Seeker is equipped with only the highest quality gear to stop the Hider. A high-tech squirt gun dilutes the Hider's goo until it is weak enough to be captured. A tracking grenade causes a chemical reaction on contact with the Hider that will cause it to leave a trail behind it for a short time. The Seeker can even detect how far away the Hider is, displaying the data on a hot-and-cold meter for maximum effectiveness - who needs numbers, anyway? The Seeker has to prevent the Hider from collecting goo until it runs out of energy, or capture it once it has been sufficiently weakened. Who are we? Brave Little Studios is a group of 9 graduate students from the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts and Engineering program.\",\n",

       " 'Giveaway The Giveaway is now closed. More than 8 000 copies of Moons of Madness and 10 000 copies of The Black Watchmen and NITE Team 4 were given for free. Congratulations to the players that won! Discover Cyrano Story! Solve challenging enigmas to uncover the mysteries on board the Cyrano spaceship. Born from an Alternate Reality Game experiment in Google AI, Cyrano Story is a short and complex puzzle game created by Alice &amp; Smith which reveals insight into the backstory of Funcom’s cosmic horror game, Moons of Madness. The game is based off of Moons of Madness and very much inspired by The Secret World universe. Originally created as a transmedia campaign to promote the release of Moons of Madness, featuring a live event in Berlin and interactive online community events, the game has since been enhanced with more puzzles and new content to replace the live elements. For hints and help, reach out to the Cyrano Story community on Discord or visit the Game Detectives walkthrough of the original ARG. Cyrano Story : A cautionary tale for space travelers. As the Invictus base faces eldritch horrors, the unaware relief crew aboard the Cyrano spaceship begins to experience strange symptoms on its approach to Mars. As the Orochi employees get closer to the red planet and its twin moons, insanity starts creeping into their minds. Thanks to the personal audio logs of Dr. Olivia Mason, Navigation Specialist for the Cyrano, we gain insight into the evolution of the team members’ daily tasks, struggles and state of mind during their journey. All the while, descending into a black hole of knowledge and torment because of the hold the planet and its secrets have on the team’s sanity. A game that learns your darkest fears and offers you insight into the Moons of Madness game! Players must interact with an unknown force and feed it answers to unlock and understand Dr. Mason’s take on the events. The mysterious force’s voice and eerie reactions will guide the player to true cosmic wisdom, or infinite madness... To start, access a moon and take the time to analyse each of the visual clues that are presented to find what links them all together. Write your answer anywhere in the floating darkness and wait for a response from the mysterious entity. Good or bad, this presence will react to all your guesses until you’ve broken the seal. Once you’ve solved the enigma, you’ll be given access to one of Dr. Olivia Mason’s transmissions. Her personal logs will give you insight about life on the Cyrano spaceship, her findings, status on the crew’s journey and much more. Keep in mind that most of these puzzles were originally designed to be solved in teams by entire online communities. So feel free to reach out the Cyrano Story fans on Discord for clues or even take a look at the various ARG collectives. You can also rely on the difficulty labels associated with each puzzle : Sane, On the edge, Crazy, Insane, Mental Breakdown or Higher plane, to brace yourself before you get in too deep.',\n",

First released in Japan in 2008, the title maintained service for 12 years. Using the lessons learned from those twelve years, CosmicBreak has been rebalanced and enhanced, keeping the core elements of what made the original CosmicBreak unique intact, while incorporating a slew of changes that could not be implemented in the original title, all developed for release on the Steam platform as CosmicBreak Universal. Not only is this an improved version, but it will also be more widely available to players around the world. CosmicBreak Universal features PvP battles of up to 30 vs. 30 players at one time. Familiar WASD controls and fast-paced Arena action makes CosmicBreak Universal quick and easy to get into for any gamer. Over 50 unique playable robots and humanoids with over 300 mix-matchable parts makes for endless customization options. Every robot has different abilities, and many feature special weapons and collectable rare parts. Using the powerful robot assembly system, you'll be able to build unique robots that are yours and yours alone. Choose from one of 3 Unions, and join forces with other heroes to lead your Union to victory! I'm a CosmicBreak vet; what's different about CosmicBreak Universal? Numerous improvements have been made towards overall game balance and usability, including the simplification of status ailments, and individual adjustments to weapons and more. We believe a greater number of players will be able to enjoy the game this way. For example, the Power stat on projectile weapons with a lengthy charge time will now be dramatically increased, and projectile speed across all weapons will be adjusted to prevent extreme outliers. We have also made refinements to the character models for several humanoids that debuted near the release of CosmicBreak. In addition, numerous changes have been made to increase the ease of access to desired robots, humanoids, and useful items.\",\n",

Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.

Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires. And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun… KEY FEATURES Faithful Recreation of Japan’s Electronics Mecca Like a virtual tour of Tokyo’s Akihabara district, all major outdoor locations from the town have been painfully recreated, with over 130 real-life shops accurately represented.

MotoGP™15 is back with a range of new features to guarantee an even more comprehensive and compelling experience.

At the end of each race, in any mode, you will receive GP Credits on the basis of the results you get on the track and the objectives achieved. As your reputation grows, you'll attract the attention of ever more distinguished sponsors, who'll ask you to achieve ever more difficult objectives. Physics and A.I.

Beat the Time With the new Beat The Time mode you can put your skills to the test by riding round a circuit and trying to beat the record set by the champions of each class, riding the same bike they were riding, with the same set-up.

OVRdrop works on SteamVR and should be fully compatible with any SteamVR headset, though you will need tracked controllers for many of the features. It is known to work for the HTC Vive as well as the Oculus Rift, though some games may not be compatible with the Rift . The only major downside is that Cross Game Overlays will always draw on top of game geometry because Depth information is not fed to the Compositor by SteamVR games. If you have any issues getting started, be sure to check the FAQ on our GitHub which I'll try to keep updated with the most common questions. If you find any bugs, please post them to our issue tracker on our GitHub. I'm at the ready to fix any bugs that are found! Compatibility OVRdrop requires Windows 8/8.1 or 10. Windows 7 not supported due to technical limitations. Support for Windows 7 is planned for the future. Limited Oculus Rift/OSVR Support! OVRdrop should work perfectly with any SteamVR compatible headset when running through SteamVR . However some games will override the SteamVR SDK when using an Oculus Rift or an OSVR HMD, and prevent SteamVR from drawing to the headset. In this case, OVRdrop will not work with those games. Please check our Compatibility guide on our GitHub for more information. Please report Oculus Rift/OSVR success or failure on our GitHub Issue Tracker. Certain Oculus Rift games can be fixed and made to work with SteamVR/OVRdrop! Please see the announcement here for more details. OVRdrop will only work on the Oculus Rift in games that do not force the Oculus SDK! This is not something that can be fixed on our end. OVRdrop will only work on the OSVR HMD in games that do not force the OSVR SDK! This is not something that can be fixed on our end.

       " \"Overview In order to improve the efficiency of selecting talents, the Chicheng police specially developed a test system-the true detection system, with the black robe company. As a tester, you need to complete the cracking of the case under the rules of the system. The cracking process of the case is very similar to the real police case. The cases in the system are all actually happened in Chicheng and are stored in the form of key clues. Each clue contains information about the clues. You need to constantly find new clues by looking at the information and fragment the clues. The content pieced together the completed case in your mind and reasoned out the course of the case. As long as you answer the correct questions about the case in the system, you can even crack a case. After cracking the case, you can view the criminal’s “criminal statement”. In the process of cracking the case, you sometimes need to perform special operations on some clues, such as inferring the motives of the characters to complete the 'search warrant' for the clues of the characters, and inferring a reasonable time to 'invoke the monitoring' to check and reason out After the correct password of the encryption clue is 'decoded', the encrypted content can be viewed and so on. The more user-friendly design is that when you have no clue, you can ask the system for help. The system will give you a certain range of tips, but a certain amount of investigative points will be deducted. After you have solved all the cases, Chicheng police will give your final evaluation based on the detection points and your performance. Thanks Thanks to Ge Meiling, Shen Yongliang, Wang Xun, GT, and Chaochao for their help in the game production process, thank you family for your understanding and support, thank all friends who helped test and promote, thank all players!\",\n",

       " \"Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark is a story-driven, turn-based tactical RPG set in a fantasy world with a touch of steampunk. Take control of the Arbiter Kyrie, an agent of the Immortal Council tasked with preserving stability and order throughout the land, and lead your troops through difficult encounters. Experience an epic and mature story , unfolding through over 40 story encounters and topped with challenging end-game content.

A deep and complex class system with over 30 classes and 300 abilities lets you truly customize every one of your characters through the selection of their class, sub-class and passives.

Customize your troops' appearance your way, by selecting their portrait, outfit, colors and overall visuals from a wide selection. Equip your army with over 240 pieces of equipment, either purchased, gathered from fallen enemies or created from crafting. Centuries ago, a brutal beast of destruction rent the world asunder. In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed. To prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos. The Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can't oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land's people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law. But one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore. Strongly influenced by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics (original and Advance versions) and Tactics Ogre, this tactical RPG stands on its own as a worthy successor of those classics, bringing a slew of improvements and additions to the tactics genre.\",\n",

       " \"In Let’s School, you take on the role of a principal tasked with the challenge of revamping and managing your alma mater! The game features two core mechanics: the construction and designing of the school and managing the dynamics of students and teachers. Each student has unique interests and aspirations, making your role as headmaster more complex. Balancing factors like your school's reputation, satisfying students' basic needs, overseeing academic pressure, and managing aspects like clothing, food, and travel provide an immersive and challenging experience. Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas! The architectural design of the school is a blank canvas for the player. With the freedom to plan and construct various functional facilities and access to hundreds of educational equipment, you define your institution's aesthetic and practical landscape. Don't limit yourself to horizontal expansion - think vertically by constructing multi-story buildings for more innovative developments or even eccentric structures! The fate of teachers and students lies in your hands. The recruitment process, teaching methodologies, and personal growth of teachers and students rest on your decisions. Enhancing the skills of your teachers opens up opportunities for them in different roles. You can influence student morale and academic performance by offering elective courses, thereby shaping their future life paths. The management of school discipline is another crucial responsibility. Be mindful of the impact of school facilities on student morale, and beware of signs of student distress. Overeating in the canteen could lead to weight gain, while an increase in eyeglass usage could signal excessive stress. Proper access to sanitary facilities is vital, as a lack thereof may lead to widespread anxiety and misuse of the school premises. To maintain discipline, monitor for contraband among students and establish an effective punishment system. Handling real-time crises such as truancy, bullying, and questioning also falls within your responsibilities. Fostering a balanced school environment through field days, morning exercises, and various events could help students regulate their emotions. Let’s School is a game of management, strategy, and decision-making, where every choice you make has far-reaching consequences!\",\n",

The Heroines Himitsu is Nikolai's childhood friend. She is kind, caring, always worries about him, and can sometimes even be too vexatious. But is she really satisfied with simple friendship?
